Drawn from the New York Times column of the same name, it features essays by an extraordinary group of prizewinning and bestselling contributors. The pieces range from reflections on the daily craft of writing to the intersection of art's and life's consequential moments. Authors discuss what impels them to write: creating a sense of control in a turbulent universe; bearing witness to events that would otherwise be lost in history or within the writer's soul; recapturing a fragment of time. Others praise mentors and lessons, whether from the classroom, daily circumstances, or the pages of a favorite writer. For anyone interested in the art and rewards of writing, Writers on writing offers an uncommon and revealing view of a writer's world. Contributors include Russell Banks, Saul Bellow, E.L. Doctorow, Louise Erdrich, Richard Ford, Carl Hiaasen, Jamaica Kincaid, Barbara Kingsolver, Sue Miller, Walter Mosley, Joyce Carol Oates, Marge Piercy, Annie Proulx, Carol Shields, Jane Smiley, John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., and Elie Wiesel.},	keywords={literature; writing & life writing},	isbn={0805067418 9780805067415 0805073612 9780805073614},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1945,	year={1999},	title={Narratologies: New perspectives on narrative analysis},	publisher={Ohio State University Press},	address={Columbus, OH},	keywords={narratology; research}}@book{RefWorks:1290,	year={1987},	title={Inventing the truth: The art and craft of memoir},	publisher={Houghton Mifflin Co.},	address={Boston, MA},	keywords={autobiography & biography; art; writing & life writing}}@inbook{RefWorks:1206,	author={T.
