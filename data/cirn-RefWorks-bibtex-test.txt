Drawn from the New York Times column of the same name, it features essays by an extraordinary group of prizewinning and bestselling contributors. The pieces range from reflections on the daily craft of writing to the intersection of art's and life's consequential moments. Authors discuss what impels them to write: creating a sense of control in a turbulent universe; bearing witness to events that would otherwise be lost in history or within the writer's soul; recapturing a fragment of time. Others praise mentors and lessons, whether from the classroom, daily circumstances, or the pages of a favorite writer. For anyone interested in the art and rewards of writing, Writers on writing offers an uncommon and revealing view of a writer's world. Contributors include Russell Banks, Saul Bellow, E.L. Doctorow, Louise Erdrich, Richard Ford, Carl Hiaasen, Jamaica Kincaid, Barbara Kingsolver, Sue Miller, Walter Mosley, Joyce Carol Oates, Marge Piercy, Annie Proulx, Carol Shields, Jane Smiley, John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., and Elie Wiesel.},	keywords={literature; writing & life writing},	isbn={0805067418 9780805067415 0805073612 9780805073614},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1945,	year={1999},	title={Narratologies: New perspectives on narrative analysis},	publisher={Ohio State University Press},	address={Columbus, OH},	keywords={narratology; research}}@book{RefWorks:1290,	year={1987},	title={Inventing the truth: The art and craft of memoir},	publisher={Houghton Mifflin Co.},	address={Boston, MA},	keywords={autobiography & biography; art; writing & life writing}}@inbook{RefWorks:1206,	author={T.

The  model delineates the processes and variables involved when AMs are  shared to serve social functions. Components of the model include:  lifespan contextual influences, the qualitative characteristics of  memory (emotionality and level of detail recalled), the speaker's  characteristics (age, gender, and personality), the familiarity and  similarity of the listener to the speaker, the level of responsiveness  during the memory-sharing process, and the nature of the social  relationship in which the memory sharing occurs (valence and length of  the relationship). These components are shown to influence the type of  social function served and/or, the extent to which social functions are  served. Directions for future empirical work to substantiate the model  and hypotheses derived from the model are provided.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; memory & reminiscence; culture},	doi={10.1080/741938207}}@book{RefWorks:1740,	author={I.

It also calls for a reexamination of recent work by Nussbaum (2004) on extending the capabilities approach to animals and the interface of Nussbaum's work with Rollin's scholarship on (1995a).

Narration and its contribution to self and identity},	journal={Theory & Psychology},	volume={21},	number={1},	pages={3-24},	abstract={This article critically examines the recent turn to narratives as tools for identity construction and identity analysis. While self and sense of self will be used largely as synonyms, the attempt is made to draw up a distinction between self (sense of self) on one hand and identity on the other. Rather than starting with a definition of features and functions of self and identity, I propose to start from the identification of three practical challenges that self and identity formation processes are facing. These three challenges will be explicated in terms of dilemmatic spaces within which identity activities—and at their center: narrating—are “navigated.” They consist of: (i) a successful diachronic navigation between constancy and change, (ii) the establishment of a synchronic connection between sameness and difference (between self and other), and (iii) the management of agency between the double-arrow of a person-to-world versus a world-to-person direction of fit. While biographical approaches (big story research) have contributed in valuable ways to identity research by exploring the links between narrative and life, they have traditionally confined themselves to the analysis of lives as texts. A narrative practice approach (small story research) is suggested to solve a number of problems and shortcomings of traditional approaches.},	keywords={identity; psychology; theory; life story}}@article{RefWorks:1476,	author={M.

Narration and its contribution to self and identity” open up opportunities to clarify. In this response I differentiate more clearly between biographic approaches to narrative and my proposal to approach identity and self as dilemmatic spaces that are navigated by way of narrative practices. While Freeman and Schachter suggest an approach to identity by highlighting narrating as first-person (mental) operations of a solitary (self-)intending and (self-)reflecting individual, and identity research as inquiry into individuals’ reflections and intentions, I clarify my alternative: narrating as an interactive practice— an approach which accentuates narrative practices taking place as situated and contextualized second-person encounters within which identities and a sense of self emerge as navigations of three dilemmatic identity spaces. In addition, in this response to Freeman’s and Schachter’s commentaries I once more attempt to underscore the merits of a practice-based approach to narrating activities for empirical identity research.},	keywords={identity; practice; research; theory; psychology}}@inbook{RefWorks:1667,	author={M.

There is a persistent tendency to think of such narratives as factual and therefore stable. The mutability of such narratives is actually a key adaptive characteristic, ranging from complete repression of individual traumas to public revisionism and debates about such events as the bombing of Hiroshima. Arguably, only those with a predictable future can afford a fixed version of the past, while those who are swept by unpredicted social change toward new learning and improvisation must also construct new narratives. This paper considers the social and individual value of multiple fluid narratives in the context of multiple belief systems of other kinds.},	keywords={community; sociology; theory; history},	isbn={0826-4805},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1260,	author={M.

Through the comparative biographies of herself and four of her close friends, Mary Catherine Bateson provides a fascinating framework for her inquiry into the creative potential of complex lives, where energies are not narrowly focused toward a single ambition but rather are continually refocused and redefined. Each of the women in Composing a Life faced discontinuity at periods in her life, yet was rich in professional achievement and personal relationships. Bateson's life-affirming conclusion is that life is an improvisational art form, and that the interruptions, conflicted priorities, and exigencies that are a part of all our lives can and should be seen as a source of wisdom. Important and empowering, Composing a Life will change lives.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; literature; women; writing & life writing; art},	isbn={0452265053 9780452265059},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:2931,	author={R.

In 63 unacquainted dyads (81 women and 45 men), a narrator  told his or her own close-call story. The listeners made 2 different  kinds of listener responses: Generic responses included nodding and  vocalizations such as "mhm." Specific responses, such as wincing or  exclaiming, were tightly connected to (and served to illustrate) what  the narrator was saying at the moment. In experimental conditions that  distracted listeners from the narrative content, listeners made fewer  responses, especially specific ones, and the narrators also told their  stories significantly less well, particularly at what should have been  the dramatic ending. Thus, listeners were co-narrators both through  their own specific responses, which helped illustrate the story, and in  their apparent effect on the narrator's performance. The results  demonstrate the importance of moment-by-moment collaboration in  face-to-face dialogue.},	keywords={psychology; sociology; theory; research},	doi={10.1037//0022-3514.79.6.941}}
