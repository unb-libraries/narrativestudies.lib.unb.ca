Drawn from the New York Times column of the same name, it features essays by an extraordinary group of prizewinning and bestselling contributors. The pieces range from reflections on the daily craft of writing to the intersection of art's and life's consequential moments. Authors discuss what impels them to write: creating a sense of control in a turbulent universe; bearing witness to events that would otherwise be lost in history or within the writer's soul; recapturing a fragment of time. Others praise mentors and lessons, whether from the classroom, daily circumstances, or the pages of a favorite writer. For anyone interested in the art and rewards of writing, Writers on writing offers an uncommon and revealing view of a writer's world. Contributors include Russell Banks, Saul Bellow, E.L. Doctorow, Louise Erdrich, Richard Ford, Carl Hiaasen, Jamaica Kincaid, Barbara Kingsolver, Sue Miller, Walter Mosley, Joyce Carol Oates, Marge Piercy, Annie Proulx, Carol Shields, Jane Smiley, John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., and Elie Wiesel.},	keywords={literature; writing & life writing},	isbn={0805067418 9780805067415 0805073612 9780805073614},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1945,	year={1999},	title={Narratologies: New perspectives on narrative analysis},	publisher={Ohio State University Press},	address={Columbus, OH},	keywords={narratology; research}}@book{RefWorks:1290,	year={1987},	title={Inventing the truth: The art and craft of memoir},	publisher={Houghton Mifflin Co.},	address={Boston, MA},	keywords={autobiography & biography; art; writing & life writing}}@inbook{RefWorks:1206,	author={T.

The  model delineates the processes and variables involved when AMs are  shared to serve social functions. Components of the model include:  lifespan contextual influences, the qualitative characteristics of  memory (emotionality and level of detail recalled), the speaker's  characteristics (age, gender, and personality), the familiarity and  similarity of the listener to the speaker, the level of responsiveness  during the memory-sharing process, and the nature of the social  relationship in which the memory sharing occurs (valence and length of  the relationship). These components are shown to influence the type of  social function served and/or, the extent to which social functions are  served. Directions for future empirical work to substantiate the model  and hypotheses derived from the model are provided.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; memory & reminiscence; culture},	doi={10.1080/741938207}}@book{RefWorks:1740,	author={I.

It also calls for a reexamination of recent work by Nussbaum (2004) on extending the capabilities approach to animals and the interface of Nussbaum's work with Rollin's scholarship on (1995a).

Narration and its contribution to self and identity},	journal={Theory & Psychology},	volume={21},	number={1},	pages={3-24},	abstract={This article critically examines the recent turn to narratives as tools for identity construction and identity analysis. While self and sense of self will be used largely as synonyms, the attempt is made to draw up a distinction between self (sense of self) on one hand and identity on the other. Rather than starting with a definition of features and functions of self and identity, I propose to start from the identification of three practical challenges that self and identity formation processes are facing. These three challenges will be explicated in terms of dilemmatic spaces within which identity activities—and at their center: narrating—are “navigated.” They consist of: (i) a successful diachronic navigation between constancy and change, (ii) the establishment of a synchronic connection between sameness and difference (between self and other), and (iii) the management of agency between the double-arrow of a person-to-world versus a world-to-person direction of fit. While biographical approaches (big story research) have contributed in valuable ways to identity research by exploring the links between narrative and life, they have traditionally confined themselves to the analysis of lives as texts. A narrative practice approach (small story research) is suggested to solve a number of problems and shortcomings of traditional approaches.},	keywords={identity; psychology; theory; life story}}@article{RefWorks:1476,	author={M.

Narration and its contribution to self and identity” open up opportunities to clarify. In this response I differentiate more clearly between biographic approaches to narrative and my proposal to approach identity and self as dilemmatic spaces that are navigated by way of narrative practices. While Freeman and Schachter suggest an approach to identity by highlighting narrating as first-person (mental) operations of a solitary (self-)intending and (self-)reflecting individual, and identity research as inquiry into individuals’ reflections and intentions, I clarify my alternative: narrating as an interactive practice— an approach which accentuates narrative practices taking place as situated and contextualized second-person encounters within which identities and a sense of self emerge as navigations of three dilemmatic identity spaces. In addition, in this response to Freeman’s and Schachter’s commentaries I once more attempt to underscore the merits of a practice-based approach to narrating activities for empirical identity research.},	keywords={identity; practice; research; theory; psychology}}@inbook{RefWorks:1667,	author={M.

There is a persistent tendency to think of such narratives as factual and therefore stable. The mutability of such narratives is actually a key adaptive characteristic, ranging from complete repression of individual traumas to public revisionism and debates about such events as the bombing of Hiroshima. Arguably, only those with a predictable future can afford a fixed version of the past, while those who are swept by unpredicted social change toward new learning and improvisation must also construct new narratives. This paper considers the social and individual value of multiple fluid narratives in the context of multiple belief systems of other kinds.},	keywords={community; sociology; theory; history},	isbn={0826-4805},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1260,	author={M.

Through the comparative biographies of herself and four of her close friends, Mary Catherine Bateson provides a fascinating framework for her inquiry into the creative potential of complex lives, where energies are not narrowly focused toward a single ambition but rather are continually refocused and redefined. Each of the women in Composing a Life faced discontinuity at periods in her life, yet was rich in professional achievement and personal relationships. Bateson's life-affirming conclusion is that life is an improvisational art form, and that the interruptions, conflicted priorities, and exigencies that are a part of all our lives can and should be seen as a source of wisdom. Important and empowering, Composing a Life will change lives.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; literature; women; writing & life writing; art},	isbn={0452265053 9780452265059},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:2931,	author={R.

In 63 unacquainted dyads (81 women and 45 men), a narrator  told his or her own close-call story. The listeners made 2 different  kinds of listener responses: Generic responses included nodding and  vocalizations such as "mhm." Specific responses, such as wincing or  exclaiming, were tightly connected to (and served to illustrate) what  the narrator was saying at the moment. In experimental conditions that  distracted listeners from the narrative content, listeners made fewer  responses, especially specific ones, and the narrators also told their  stories significantly less well, particularly at what should have been  the dramatic ending. Thus, listeners were co-narrators both through  their own specific responses, which helped illustrate the story, and in  their apparent effect on the narrator's performance. The results  demonstrate the importance of moment-by-moment collaboration in  face-to-face dialogue.},	keywords={psychology; sociology; theory; research},	doi={10.1037//0022-3514.79.6.941}}@article{RefWorks:843,	author={Janet B.

Narrative analysis acknowledges the  way people tell their stories as integral to the meaning they convey.  But definitions of narrative are often linear and causal and are  closely linked to the conventions of storytelling that are dominant in  our culture. Recognising that link enables the listener/reader to go  beyond; to follow disjointed, chaotic accounts that are not easy to  hear, and to situate speakers within or outside of dominant discourses.  I argue that such a hearing contributes to an understanding of the self  that provides an alternative to the modernist idea of an autonomous,  self-controlled and independent individual, an alternative that values  the lives and narratives of older people.},	keywords={gerontology & aging; life story; medicine; illness},	isbn={08904065}}@book{RefWorks:2806,	author={G.

The concept of Referee Design complements the responsive,  audience-designed dimension of style. I argue that the  responsive/initiative distinction is an instance of the  structure/agency duality recognized in social theory. I examine a  series of New Zealand television advertisements which make an overtly  nationalistic appeal to the majority Pakeha (Anglo) group, associating  their product through referee design with core cultural stereotypes.  One such advertisement presents four different renditions of a Māori  song—performed by a Māori opera singer with native-like pronunciation,  by a group in an Irish pub, by an African American using recognizably  AAVE features, and by a young Pakeha man using anglicized  pronunciation. The phonology of the performances is examined through a  three-level approach combining qualitative, quantitative and  co-occurrence analysis. The pronunciation of the three non-native  performances works together with the visual and musical tracks to  constitute the singers' identities and their relation to New Zealand.  The findings illustrate the blend of responsive and initiative style in  performance, and the ambivalence of a Pakeha identity that uses the  forms of a disadvantaged national minority to constitute itself.},	keywords={identity; subcultures; race & ethnicity; art; theory; culture},	doi={10.1111/1467-9481.00094}}@article{RefWorks:2157,	author={K.

As we rush to get "on line," as we make the transition from book to screen, says Birkerts, we are turning against some of the core premises of humanism - indeed, we are putting the idea of individualism itself under threat. The printed page and the circuit driven information technologies are not kindred - for Birkerts they represent fundamentally opposed forces. In their inevitable confrontation our deepest values will be tested. Birkerts begins his exploration from the reader's perspective, first in several highly personal accounts of his own passion for the book, then in a suite of essays that examines what he calls "the ulterior life of reading." Against this, Birkerts sets out the contours of the transformed landscape. In his highly provocative essay "Into the Electronic Millennium" and in meditations on CD-ROM, hypertext, and audio books, he plumbs the impact of emerging technologies on the once stable reader-writer exchange. He follows these with a look at the changing climate of criticism and literary practice. He concludes with a blistering indictment of what he sees as our willingness to strike a Faustian pact with a seductive devil.},	keywords={literature; theory; digital storytelling; culture},	isbn={057119849X : 9780571198498},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1964,	editor={J.

This is puzzling, since, in certain contexts, violence may stifle narrative production. Researchers of atrocities, for example, propose that the experience of recurring terror disrupts narrative cohesion in reporting lived trauma. Genocidal horror occurs in the context of communities and ethnic groups. Our rape survival data from women of three populations in the southwestern United States reflect traumas of sexual violence against women, experienced within everyday lives. From interviews with 62 female rape survivors, we (1) identify narrative conventions and linguistic devices to show how these women structure accounts of sexual assault that reflect their cultural background; (2) contrast scripts of coercion and consent; (3) examine how the way in which these women describe the coercive actions of the perpetrator(s) contradicts the assumptions of legal discourse; and (4) discuss the narrative production of several women in abusive relationships and compare it to the narrative production (or lack thereof) of persons who experience state-engineered terror.},	isbn={0145-9740},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1796,	author={J.

It offers opportunities for analyzing 'voice'. The ways in which speakers themselves organize stories along indexical patterns of emphasis, focus, super- and subordination and so on. As such, it is a potentially very useful tool for tracking 'local' patterns of meaning-making in narrative. I argue that ethnopoetics could be productively applied to data in which different systems of meaning-making meet -- a condition that defines many important service-providing systems in globalizing contexts. Asylum applications in Western Europe are a case in point, and examples will be used from that domain, but the potential usefulness of such an applied ethnopoetics stretches into many other types of service encounters in which crosscultural storytelling is crucial.},	keywords={life story; subcultures; research; theory; anthropology},	isbn={1387-6740}}@article{RefWorks:111,	author={J.

We introduce a new construct, the life story schema, a skeletal mental representation of life's major components and links. The life story schema provides 5 conceptual extensions to current models of autobiographical memory. The conclusion that results from these extensions is that the life story schema serves to bind autobiographical memory and the self over time.

By locating narrative theories of identity in relation to two other theoretical frameworks, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and Ricoeur's hermeneutics of textuality, we create a new theoretical approach for thinking about the possibilities and constraints for understanding sociohistorical questions of identity. As opposed to postmodern discursive deconstructions of the self or identity, we argue that the contextual imperatives of the developing world necessitate and demand the active interpretation and articulation of our-selves in stories and texts.

Why is it that some stories - confessions, victim impact statements - can be excluded from decisionmakers' hearing? What rhetorical strategies do judges use to gain persuasiveness or to claim authority to impose certain stories on reality?

It suggests that the story produced of the                self is not inevitable and may revolve around notions of sameness and difference                that, in turn, depend on the positionality of individuals in terms of normative                discourses of `race', class and gender. Sally can be seen to be reciting the process                of subjection in the way she creates herself as the subject of a narrative, using                tropes of difference and sameness to explain who she is and who she is not. However,                for the others, the norms and conventions of lifestory do not conform with their                experiences of subjection. This is because, in the case of Madeleine, she does not                experience an easily retold sense of herself, while Deborah appears to want to                present herself as so inevitable and conforming to dominant norms that there is no                story to tell.},	keywords={life story; race & ethnicity; identity; research},	doi={10.1177/1464700103004001002}}@article{RefWorks:1371,	author={R.

In this study, we employ Kant's concept of maturity to develop insight into entrepreneurial goals as socially embedded. Drawing on a narrative orientation we explore how entrepreneurs articulate their goals and the images they use to metaphorically express these goals. We find that entrepreneurs articulate goals that evoke public, social and moral concerns alongside the more commonly accepted entrepreneurial goals of independence and challenging existing orthodoxies.

Adolescent development among this population demonstrates remarkable historical variability along the lines of generation-cohort, revealing the utility of a life-course approach to the study of normal adolescence. Concepts of normal adolescence appear to shift with changing narratives of identity for sexual minority youth. We contrast two narratives of gay youth identity development that have emerged since the inception of substantive research programs on gay adolescence: (1) the narrative of struggle and success that came to dominate the literature in the 1980s and 1990s and (2) the narrative of emancipation that has emerged from the work of Savin-Williams and others who argue for a recognition of the diversity of adolescent development for this population. In relating this contrast to Offer's seminal contributions to the study of adolescence, we suggest that the most normative feature of human development, particularly during adolescence, is its connection to discourses of identity through the formation of personal narratives that anchor the life course and provide meaning to conceptions of self-development. The example of shifting narratives of gay youth identity development is meant to exemplify this characteristic feature of human development.

For individuals to participate successfully  in Meeting they are required to present and then reconstruct their  autobiographical selves in response to their increasing familiarisation  both with well-known canonic texts and also the local expression of  these texts.

In finding traces of another within oneself, as one does in encountering the narrative of another, the Self is able to appreciate its own meaning. But the narrative represents more than merely capturing another's story. In meeting the eyes and hearing the story of another, one not only takes responsibility for the Other; one begins to assume responsibility for oneself. The encounter inherent in the narrative, therefore, gives birth to the devotion of one person to another and makes possible the discovery of what one defines as being human.},	keywords={identity; theory; philosophy},	isbn={1077-8004},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:2796,	author={S.

However, follow-up studies at school age report that preterm children born without major impairment have more subtle impairments, including language difficulties, which influence their ability to function. These findings indicate a need to examine specific language-processing skills in children born preterm across the school years.Aims: To compare oral narrative skills of children born preterm with their peers born at full term.Methods & Procedures: The research used an independent groups design to examine the narrative ability of 30 children aged between 9 years; 8 months and 10 years; 11 months: 15 children born before 33 weeks' gestation (preterm group) and 15 children matched for chronological age born at full gestation (greater than 38 weeks). Seven measures assessed productivity, structure, complexity, and formulation abilities. The research used univariate analysis to examine variations in outcomes based on group status (preterm versus full term).Outcomes & Results: The results showed group effects on the formulation measures but not the productivity, complexity or quality measures. Children born preterm produced more utterances with mazes and had more disruptions than children born at full term. The children born preterm demonstrated difficulties formulating a narrative even though they produced a similar amount and used similar structural aspects to their peers born full term.Conclusions & Implications: Children born preterm show subtle and specific linguistic deficits that continue to affect their ability to formulate a narrative in the upper primary school years.},	isbn={1368-2822},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:795,	author={John Dominic Crossan},	year={1975},	title={The dark interval : towards a theology of story},	publisher={Argus Communications},	address={Niles, IL},	note={ID: 1959364},	keywords={spirituality; theology; life story},	isbn={0913592528 : 9780913592526},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:2086,	author={M.

The sexual segregation of the mainly Muslim society was reflected in the different expressions of distress used in the female and male narratives. Women felt ‘pressurized’, ‘suffocated’, ‘nervy’, with their emotions about to explode. Their suicide attempts were spontaneous outbursts of emotional frustration. Men appeared ‘worn out’, ‘tired’, ‘depressed’ and dying seemed more honourable than living unable to gain status or even become a social adult male. These narratives of suffocation and frustration provide some understanding of reactions to the current dire political and economic situation faced by Palestinians living under siege as Israel uses ever more drastic measures to subdue the population. For suicide bombers, death may also seem more honourable than life under oppression.},	isbn={1364-8470},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1308,	author={S.

Alongside identity development, social-cognitive development, and the ability to construct a life story, adolescents become increasingly aware of both their potential responsibility in an expanded sphere of life and of complex, contextual influences on their lives. This was partially tested in a cross-sectional study, both in terms of linguistic means and content expressed in life narratives. Indicators were defined for narrative agency, grading of responsibility, serendipity, and turning points, and tested for age differences in relative frequencies in 102 life narratives from age groups of 8, 12, 16, and 20 years, balanced for gender. Narrative grading of responsibility, serendipity, and turning points increased throughout adolescence. The relative frequency of narrative agency, in contrast, remained constant across age groups. Results are interpreted in the context of adolescent development of narrative identity.},	isbn={0022-1325},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:493,	author={B. de Vries and J. E. Birren and D.

Narratives are formats for self-creation;  they can also be used to provide support or education, promote  self-understanding and interpersonal effectiveness. Already familiar in  self-help groups and reminiscence groups for the elderly, narrative  approaches can be useful in many other formats. In this paper I discuss  ways of eliciting narratives, understanding their meaning from many  perspectives and using them to promote growth and healing in groups.  The group leader's role is reconfigured into that of participant  observer and manager of the group process. It is up to the leader to  provide a context in which multiple accounts can emerge for  consideration.},	keywords={theory; practice; therapy; psychology; social work}}@inproceedings{RefWorks:1495,	author={D.

The illness and its treatment, which often lasts for months, create physical burdens, and, in addition, make heavy psychological and social demands on the children and their relatives. The associated experiences are part of their personal life history and must be integrated into the further psychological development in some way. In order to test the hypothesis that the ability to design personal narrative around these experiences assists in overcoming them, 60 adult former patients who had suffered cancer during their childhood, and 33 of their siblings, were asked how they had experienced the illness and treatment. In this article the terms Integration and Narrative will first be defined and an attempt made to conceptualize the psychic integration of the illness experience. Using excerpts from the narratives of two pairs of siblings, it will be shown how individually the experiences of illness are integrated and the major significance of intrafamilial communication for the mode of coping with the illness and for the sibling relationship. Finally, the relevance of narrative and integration for the overcoming of illness experience and for clinical psycho-oncological work with children with cancer and their families will be critically discussed.},	isbn={1359-1045},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:2085,	author={M.

Interpretation resembles scientific explanation in that it is concerned with laws. Both interpretation and scientific explanation depend on tuning patterns of salience by representing paradigm scenarios and their relationship to ceteris paribus generalizations. In this context, a Kantian parallel between the interplay of sensory, emotive, and conceptual capacities in cognition and aesthetic experience can be drawn.

Adopting a concept of power as a contingent outcome in a social transaction, they emphasize that not only dominant, institutionalized power but also resistance to institutionalized authority draws from a common pool of sociocultural resources, including symbolic, linguistic, organizational, and material phenomena. Although such acts of resistance may not cumulate to produce institutional change, they may nonetheless have consequences beyond the specific social transaction: the authors propose that a chief means for extending the social consequences of resistance is to transform an act of resistance into a story about resistance. Based upon an appreciation of the structural conditions of power and authority, stories of resistance can become instructions about both the sources and the limitations of power. Because such stories are told in interaction with other stories, they become part of a stream of sociocultural knowledge about how social structures work to distribute power and disadvantage.},	keywords={subculture; sociology; politics},	isbn={0002-9602/2003/10806-0005}}@article{RefWorks:90,	author={P.

Because narratives are situationally produced and interpreted, they have no necessary political or epistemological valence but depend on the particular context and organization of their production for their political effect. The analysis specifies the variable conditions that produce hegemonic tales -- stories that reproduce existing relations of power and inequity -- and subversive stories -- narratives that challenge the taken-for-granted hegemony by making visible and explicit the connections between particular lives nd social organization.},	keywords={sociology; education; life story; theory}}@article{RefWorks:213,	author={D.

In response, people often experience  transformations in values, spirituality and life priorities. Drawing on  a combined quantitative and qualitative study of people living with  HIV/AIDS in Australia, three different narratives that people use to  make sense of their illness experience are identified: linear  restitution narratives, linear chaotic narratives and polyphonic  narratives. Linear illness narratives colonise the future, assuming  that the future can be controlled through human action. They emphasise  a faith in medical science, tend to be secular and self-centred and  assume the end of life to be in the distant future. Hope is focused on  concrete outcomes such as improved health or material possessions.  Linear narratives can be either restitutive or chaotic. Restitutive  linear narratives anticipate a life that will mirror the narrative.  Chaotic linear narratives anticipate a life that will fail to meet the  linear ideal resulting in despair and depression. In contrast,  polyphonic illness narratives are oriented toward the present,  emphasising the unpredictability of the future. These narratives tend  to include spiritual experiences, a communally oriented value system,  and to recount increased self-understanding and the gaining of new  insights as a consequence of their illness. Hope in polyphonic  narratives is more abstract and focused on a celebration of mystery,  surprise and creativity.},	keywords={illness; spirituality; medicine; identity},	isbn={0277-9536}}@article{RefWorks:301,	author={D.

Combining the  insights of Ricœur's philosophical analysis with Mead's  social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and  potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity  implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an  impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a  subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the  events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells  about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is  illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the  experience of mental patients.

Qualitative methodologies  often assume reported data accurately reflects the realities of lived  experience. On the other hand some research drawing on cultural studies  argues that the facts  of a person's life are irrelevant. This paper argues for a middle way  based on narrative theory that explores the interaction of objective events and their subjective  interpretation. Further, narrative analysis enables exploration of the  temporal structure of people's experiences focusing on both how a  person's memories of the past and anticipations of the future influence  their understanding and actions in the present. These points are  developed drawing on the theory and methodology of both Symbolic  Interactionism and Paul Ricoeur's Hermeneutics. The experiences of  people living with HIV/AIDS are used to illustrate and explicate the  usefulness of narrative analysis.},	keywords={theory; identity; research; memory & reminiscence; medicine; illness}}@book{RefWorks:2844,	editor={N.

Divergent in aim from the historic search for similar tonalities between the Synchronists and Stravinsky or atonal musicians of the 1950s-70s and minimalist painters and sculptors, the present use of the visual arts as a source for performing arts productions suggests a new-found narrative. The striking silence of paint and charcoal is enlivened by the portrayal of individual traits and interactions between artists and models, artist and viewer. Visual artists, talking about personal desires and aesthetic intentions are immediate sources for creative storytellers in the literary and performing arts. Contemporary novels based on historical themes and subjects have created characters based on the lives and works of famous and intriguing artists such as Michelangelo Caravaggio, Georges de La Tour and Jan Vermeer. The silence and pensive qualities of the figures of Jan Vermeer, the 17th century Dutch painter, have been the catalyst for two books, The Girl in Hyacinth Blue (1999) by Susan Vreeland and the Girl with the Pearl Earring (2001) by Tracy Chevalier. David Huddle has two running narratives in La Tour Dreams of the Wolf Girl (2002) putting Georges de La Tour in and out of contemporary space. M the Man who became Caravaggio (1998) by Peter Robb tackles the issue of patronage intertwined with personal and artistic introspections. In recent memory, theatrical and dance performances "Contact" by Susan Stroman and John Weidman, "Art" by Yasmina Reza, "Sunday in the Park with George" by Stephen Sondheim, book by James Lapine, "Les Miserables" by Claude-Michel Schfonberg/music and others, "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" by Steve Martin, and "The Sleep of Reason" by Antonia Buero-Vallego have taken the not-so-dead-life (natura morta) or still life of painting into the vital arena of the performing arts. The quest to seek intra-discipline aesthetics among dance, music, theater, and the visual arts is not the charge, but instead a turn to establish a narrative, that has brought about this invasion of interactivity between the arts.},	isbn={0021-8510},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:773,	author={Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner},	year={2002},	title={The way we think : conceptual blending and the mind's hidden complexities},	publisher={Basic Books},	address={New York},	note={ID: 48475146},	abstract={"Until recently, cognitive science has focused on such mental functions as problem solving, grammar, and pattern recognition - the functions, in other words, in which the human mind most resembles a computer. But human beings are more than computers: We invent new meanings, make discoveries, have new ideas that never existed before, and use our powerful imaginations routinely in everyday life. Cognitive science, at last, is focusing on these mysterious, creative aspects of the mind." "A major statement by two of the world's leading cognitive scientists, The Way We Think is an analysis of the imaginative nature of the human mind. The research program of conceptual blending is already widely known; this book, written to be accessible to lay readers and students as well as interested scientists, is its definitive statement. Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner show that conceptual blending is at the root of the cognitively modern human mind - the mind that human beings have worked with since the Upper Paleolithic Age. Conceptual blends themselves are repeatedly blended and reblended by people and their cultures to create the rich fabric of the way we live. Learning and navigating these blends is the crucial mental activity of the developing child."--BOOK JACKET.},	keywords={discourse; children; identity; technology},	isbn={046508785X 9780465087853},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:1525,	author={A.

Data on the social and private speech of 22 five-year-olds were collected during single hour-long group play sessions. In a later session, children heard extracts from an audio recording of an earlier group discussion, and were asked to state which of each pair of extracts contained their own speech. It was found that children's performance on this speech recognition task was positively correlate with both proportional and frequency measures of private speech. These was no relationship between the speech recognition measure and frequencies of social speech of overall verbosity; and persormance on a test of children's ability to recognize their own speech in isolation was no better than chance. We suggest that these findings are consistent with private speech having a specific function in the development of an understanding of oneself as a speaking agent among other such speakers.},	keywords={research; children; psychology}}@article{RefWorks:1592,	author={B.

Arguing from feminist and sociocultural theories, I make a distinction between being silenced and being silent; when being silenced is contrasted with voice, it is conceptualised as imposed, and it signifies a loss of power and self. But silence can also be conceptualised as being silent, a shared understanding that need not be voiced. More specifically, culturally dominant narratives provide for shared understandings that can remain silent; deviations from the norm call for voice, and thus in this case silence is power and voice expresses loss of power. At both the cultural and the individual level, there are tensions between culturally dominant and prescriptive narratives and narratives of resistance and deviation, leading to an ongoing dialectic between voice and silence. I end with a discussion of why, ultimately, it matters what is voiced and what is silenced for memory, identity and well-being.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; feminism; memory & reminiscence; identity; culture; sociology},	isbn={0965-8211},	language={EN}}@article{RefWorks:768,	author={Robyn Fivush},	year={2008},	title={Remembering and reminiscing: How individual lives are constructed in family narratives},	journal={Memory Studies},	volume={1},	number={1},	pages={49-58},	note={ID: 437837301},	abstract={Stories we tell about our lives very much define who we are as individuals, within particular families, cultures and historical periods. In this article, I review psychological research that demonstrates how autobiographical memories are created and re-created in daily interactions in which we share our stories with others, and how this process is modulated by individual, gendered and cultural models of self expressed in everyday family reminiscing. I focus on two critical developmental periods: the preschool years when autobiography is just beginning to emerge; and adolescence when autobiographical memories begin to coalesce into an overarching life narrative that defines self, others and values. I show how individual differences in the ways in which families reminisce are related to individual autobiographical narratives. Importantly, just as our individual narratives are shaped by cultural and historical models of selves and lives, individuals come to shape their culture and their historical moment by the stories they tell.},	keywords={family; memory & reminiscence; identity; psychology},	isbn={1750-6980},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1113,	author={Robyn Fivush},	editor={Neisser,U. and Fivush,R.},	year={1994},	title={Constructing narrative, emotion, and self in parent-child conversations about the past},	series={The remembered self},	publisher={Cambridge University Press},	address={New York, NY},	pages={136-157},	keywords={identity; family; emotion; children}}@book{RefWorks:767,	author={Robyn Fivush and Catherine A.

People tell stories to make sense of their suffering; when they turn their diseases into stories, they find healing. Drawing on the work of authors such as Oliver Sacks, Anatole Broyard, Norman Cousins, and Audre Lorde, as well as on the stories of people he has met during years spent among different illness groups, Frank recounts a stirring collection of illness narratives, ranging from the well-known - Gilda Radner's battle with ovarian cancer - to the private testimonials of people with cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, and disabilities. Their stories are more than accounts of personal suffering: they abound with moral choices and point to a social ethic. Frank identifies three basic narratives of illness - stories of restitution, chaos, and quest. Restitution narratives anticipate getting well and give prominence to the technology of cure. In chaos narratives, illness seems to stretch on forever, with no respite or redeeming insights. Quest narratives are about finding that illness can be transformed into a means for the ill person to become someone new. Understanding these three narrative types helps us to hear the ill, but ultimately illness stories are more. Frank presents these stories as a form of testimony: the ill person is more than a survivor; she is a witness. Schooled in a "pedagogy of suffering," the ill person reaches out to others, offering a truth about living. The truth is a starting point for a "narrative ethics," as private experiences become public voices. Wounded storytellers teach more than a new way to understand illness; they exemplify an emerging ethic of postmodern times.},	keywords={ethics & morality; medicine; illness},	isbn={0226259927 9780226259925},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1892,	author={V.

Narration and its contribution to self and identity” is an important attempt to locate the fashioning of self and identity in those sorts of local, relational, interactive practices found in everyday life. Valuable though this “small story” perspective is for turning our attention to these more local narrative practices, it is but one inroad into the formation of self and identity. Rather than serving as an alternative to those “big story” approaches that rely on individuals reflectively taking stock of larger segments of life (as in memoirs, autobiographies, and other such life narratives), it is thus more appropriately seen as a useful complement. Also argued herein is that the local narrative practices being considered, rather than serving as the source of self and identity formation, are more appropriately seen as the interactive sites in which they are expressed and refigured. Only by integrating small story and big story perspectives, therefore, can we begin to tell the whole story of who we are.},	keywords={life story; identity; psychology}}@book{RefWorks:756,	author={M.

Consider Tolstoy's harrowing tale of Ivan Ilych, revisiting his past on the eve of his death, only to realize that the life he had been living was a lie. Consider as well the many times in our own lives when, upon reviewing the past, we are able to see what we could not, or would not, see earlier on." "Hindsight is also intimately connected to what Freeman calls narrative reflection: Through the distance conferred by time, we can look back on past experiences and see them anew, as episodes in an evolving story. As important as "being in the now" and "living in the moment" are, it is no less important to pause at times and, by looking backward, seek to discern those aspects of experience that might otherwise escape our notice. Far from necessarily leading to deception and lies, therefore, hindsight can lead to wisdom and indeed truth - of a sort, Freeman contends, is only available in retrospect." "In addition to serving as a central site of self-knowledge, hindsight plays an integral role in the process of moral growth. For, through hindsight, there emerges the opportunity not only to see the possible errors of our ways but to transcend them and thereby to move on to better ways of being in the world. Drawing on psychology, philosophy, literature, and personal experience, this wide-ranging volume offers an insightful and engaging exploration of the role of hindsight both in discerning the personal past and in deepening moral life."--BOOK JACKET.},	keywords={psychology; philosophy; literature; ethics & morality; memory & reminiscence},	isbn={9780195389937 019538993X},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1661,	author={M.

Perhaps foremost among them is the fact that while living takes place now, in the present moment, telling must await the passage of time. This element of delay, it is argued, underscores the potential importance of narrative: in the context of moral life especially, it can serve a kind of rescue function, allowing for a measure of insight often unavailable in the flux of the moment. These discontinuities between life and literature notwithstanding, it is maintained herein that there also exist deep continuities between life and literature, and that literature can illuminate life precisely because it articulates and binds those features of experience that reach for narrative. By spelling out these continuities, we open the way toward deepening our understanding of the narrative fabric of life itself.},	keywords={literature},	isbn={0826-4805},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:155,	author={M.

The latter, it may be argued, inevitably entail a problematic  distance from everyday reality and may thus be said to embody life “on  holiday.” On one level, this is surely true: big stories, insofar as  they entail a significant measure of reflection on either an episode, a  portion of a life, or the whole of it, are a step removed from those  everyday goings-on that are the focus of small stories. Far from  necessarily being a liability, however, the distance that is intrinsic  to big story narrative reflection creates opportunities for  understanding that are largely unavailable in the immediacy of the  moment.

People may seek to bind these moments together as narratives in the course of their efforts at self-understanding; but these narratives, it is often held, are little more than fictions or myths, impositions of form and order upon the flux of experience. In Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilych, we find a powerful refutation of this view. For what we see in Tolstoy's story are the grave consequences of a life lived moment to moment, without any sense of the whole. Only in the face of death could Ivan Ilych gain the requisite distance to behold the true meaning of his dismal life and only upon beholding this meaning could he see the contours of the life well-lived, that is, the life possessed of narrative integrity. By exploring the relationship between death, narrative integrity, and the radical challenge of self-understanding via the story of Ivan Ilych, the present essay seeks ultimately to identify ways in which the study of ageing might contribute to our identifying the good and virtuous life.},	keywords={literature; identity; gerontology & aging; ethics & morality; death & dying},	isbn={0144-686X},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:504,	author={M.

Aims: We sought to further our understanding of the development of narrative thought during adolescence, particularly in terms of the structure and content of narrative interpretations. Sample: Participants were 151 grade 4 to grade 12 students from six schools in a major urban centre in Western Canada. They included average and high-average students. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used with four age groups: 10, 12, 14 and 17 years. Participants read a short story incorporating two substories and multiple layers of meaning. They then summarized it, described the two main characters, generated story morals and answered multiple choice interpretation questions. Responses were scored for both structural complexity and social-psychological content of narrative thought. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance were conducted to identify developmental trends. Results: A clear developmental pattern in structural complexity was discerned in which students were increasingly able to understand complex multiple layers of meaning within a story. A striking shift in social-psychological thought was also identified as students demonstrated understanding that moved from an intentional focus on immediate and specific mental states to an increasingly interpretive focus on enduring states, character traits and second-order psychological interpretations. Conclusion: Significant transformation occurs during adolescence in the structure and content of narrative thought as well as in capacity for the fundamental human endeavour of meaning-making.},	isbn={0007-0998},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:2832,	author={G.

Contemporary research examines the types of psychological processes that give rise to literary impact. The article describes experiments in two broad areas. First, it supports a position called the willing construction of disbelief and relates that to readers' feelings of having been transported to narrative worlds. The data suggest that readers must expend strategic effort to reject the information they acquire from literary narratives. Second, the article discusses the ways in which the unfolding of causes and consequences in literary narratives affect readers' judgments and understanding of characters and outcomes. These experiments support the claim that readers may derive bodies of evidence from their literary experiences that they apply to their own life experiences.},	keywords={psychology; literature},	isbn={0333-5372},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:743,	author={Richard J.

Rather less  attention has been focused on the shop as the locus of such relations,  as the space of a cultural imagining in post-industrial society, and as  a recurring symbol in many cultural documents. Some of the key literary  accounts of the role and place of the emerging modern retail space in  the nineteenth century indicate a particular spatial conceptualisation,  of the 'shop-as-world'—totalising, compartmentalised, and recursive.  This conceptualisation establishes the locus for later and more  fantastical attitudes to the shop, which associate it with fate, a  compelling power over the individual's actions and entire life, the  objectification and dehumanisation of the individual in various ways,  and ultimately decline and death. This cultural typology of the shop,  admittedly one of several possible attitudes, is nevertheless recurrent  enough to be significant, and to indicate some of the ways in which  attitudes to commodities are displaced onto persons through the  mediating agency and space of the shop. The overdetermined and anxious  symbolism of the shop in such cultural texts is thus a means of  simultaneously extending commodity attitudes and values to human  relations, as well as of figuring the commodity in human terms of  fatalism, deracination, repetition and death.},	keywords={culture; sociology; theory; philosophy},	doi={10.1080/10350330220131340}}@book{RefWorks:738,	author={Joseph Gold},	year={2002},	title={The story species : our life-literature connection},	publisher={Fitzhenry & Whiteside},	address={Markham, Ont.},	note={ID: 46703295},	keywords={life story; literature},	isbn={1550417363 9781550417364 155041643X 9781550416435 1550416030 9781550416039},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:739,	author={Joseph Gold},	year={1990},	title={Read for your life : literature as a life support system},	publisher={Fitzhenry & Whiteside},	address={Markham, Ont.},	note={ID: 19628222},	keywords={literature; life story},	isbn={0889028737 : 9780889028739},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:2788,	author={M.

Analytic concepts from reader response theory bring attention to aspects of both the overall life story and the stories told about illness. In particular, we identify 'subjunvtivizing tactics' present in the narrative representation of illness that allow sufferers and their families to justify continued care-seeking and to maintain hope for positive, even "miraculous," outcomes. In particular, these narratives maintain multiple perspectives and the potential for multiple readings, suggesting alternative plots about source and outcome of illness, and they represent potency and the possibilities for healing through stories of encounters with the mysterious.},	keywords={race & ethnicity; illness; subculture; theory; practice; research}}@article{RefWorks:3105,	author={David W.

In the study reported here, undergraduate participants (N = 152) read a narrative about a homosexual man attending his college fraternity reunion, rated their transportation into the story, rated the perceived realism of the story, and responded to statements describing story-relevant beliefs. Transportation was positively correlated with perceived realism. Furthermore, individuals with prior knowledge or experience relevant to the themes of the story (e.g., had homosexual friends or family members, were knowledgeable about American fraternities) showed greater transportation into the story. Highly transported readers showed more story-consistent beliefs, and the positive relationship between transportation and story-consistent beliefs held for those both with and without previous relevant experience.},	keywords={queer studies; research},	isbn={0163-853X},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:1367,	author={V.

Targeting men as well as women, our culture pressures us to shed youthful attributes and optimism about the future. This, she says, constitutes the "middle crisis" of our time - not a private psychological condition but a collective problem. Even our reactions have been channeled: buying remedies, telling stories of self-hating nostalgia, feeling envy of youth, alienation from the elderly, and fearing fifty. Gullette asks us to open our eyes to this manipulation and to resist it. This controversial call to arms is part autobiography, part cultural commentary, part theory, and part passion. In moving, skeptical, funny stories Gullette reflects on her childhood revenge fantasies, her political anguish, the early diagnosis of her arthritis, the rifts between midlife mothers and adult children, and her twenty-fifth-year college reunion. Analyzing cartoons, fiction, ads, and news, Declining to Decline addresses the full spectrum of midlife phenomena, from the sexual politics of midlife male bodies, to the contradictions of menopausal discourse, to how middle-ageism comes into play in a downsizing economy. Gullette reasons that forming a new anti-middle-ageism community depends on understanding how thoroughly and subtly culture now constructs midlife selfhood and expects our subservience. Evolving out of this subservience, the author proposes the concept of "age identity," a complex and satisfying way of telling our narratives of being and becoming over the entire life course.},	keywords={gender; culture; adolescence; gerontology & aging},	isbn={0813917212 9780813917214},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1678,	author={Janet Varner Gunn},	year={1982},	title={Autobiography: Toward a poetics of experience},	publisher={University of Pennsylvania Press},	address={Philadelphia},	keywords={autobiography & biography; identity}}@inbook{RefWorks:1679,	author={Janet Varner Gunn},	year={1982},	title={The autobiographical situation},	series={Autobiography: Toward a poetics of experience},	publisher={University of Pennsylvania Press},	address={Philadelphia},	pages={3-28},	keywords={autobiography & biography; memory & reminiscence}}@inbook{RefWorks:2965,	author={T.

By age 12, the majority of life narratives began with birth, ended in the present, and followed a chronological order.

This article presents a theoretical analysis and four case studies centering on the relationship among context, desire, and identity for youth with same-sex desire. Through an interpretive, holistic analysis of the personal narratives of youth, we examine the integration of same-sex desire, behavior, and identity in the general life story and the selective appropriation of elements of "master narratives" of sexual identity development. Narratives were characterized by challenges to integrate desire, behavior, and identity into a configuration that conformed to the received sexual taxonomy. Implications for theory and further research on sexual identity development are discussed.

First, we highlight Cohler's emphasis on an interpretive, idiographic approach to the study of lives and reveal the radicalism of this approach, particularly in its ability to interrogate the lived experience of social categorization. Second, we link Cohler's position directly to cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) and consider the link between inner and social speech through the idea of narrative engagement. Finally, following Cohler's life course perspective on human development, we suggest that adulthood is best conceived as a cultural discourse to which individuals orient their personal narratives through a dynamic process of narrative engagement rather than a clearly demarcated life stage. Emerging adulthood is linked to cultural and economic processes of globalization in the 21st century and challenges static notions of social roles traditionally associated with compulsory heterosexuality (e.g., marriage and parenthood). Narrative processes in emerging adulthood occur through both situated storytelling and the formation of a life story that provides coherence and social meaning, both of which have key implications for social stasis and change. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},	isbn={1520-3247},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:3088,	author={Phillip Hammack },	year={2008},	title={Narrative and the Cultural Psychology of Identity},	journal={Personality and Social Psychology Review},	volume={12},	number={3},	pages={222-247},	note={ID: 438298576},	abstract={This article presents a tripartite model of identity that integrates cognitive, social, and cultural levels of analysis in a multimethod framework. With a focus on content, structure, and process, identity is defined as ideology cognized through the individual engagement with discourse, made manifest in a personal narrative constructed and reconstructed across the life course, and scripted in and through social interaction and social practice. This approach to the study of identity challenges personality and social psychologists to consider a cultural psychology framework that focuses on the relationship between master narratives and personal narratives of identity, recognizes the value of a developmental perspective, and uses ethnographic and idiographic methods. Research in personality and social psychology that either explicitly or implicitly relies on the model is reviewed.},	isbn={1088-8683},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1123,	author={Patricia Hampl},	year={2000},	title={Memory and imagination},	series={I could tell you stories: Sojourns in the land of memory},	publisher={Norton & Comapny},	address={New York, NY},	pages={21-37},	keywords={memory & reminiscence}}@book{RefWorks:727,	author={Patricia Hampl},	year={1999},	title={I could tell you stories : sojourns in the land of memory},	publisher={W.W.

On the basis of their ethnographic fieldwork in residential-cancer rehabilitation courses, the authors examine the new rehabilitation discourse. They argue that this discourse has challenged the dominant illness narrative, “sick-helped-cured,” producing a new narrative, “sick-helped-as if cured,” and that this new narrative is produced and reproduced through technologies of power and of the self.},	isbn={0745-5194},	language={English}}@misc{RefWorks:3053,	author={Per Krogh Hansen },	year={2011},	title={Strange voices in narrative fiction},	note={ID: 769190334},	abstract={How does narratology relate to narrative strangeness?

We furthermore claim that life history dialogue fits well with                 Habermas’ concern regarding the hegemony of technical rationality.                 Habermas asserts that norms and normative institutional arrangements are just or                 valid if and only if they represent genuine consensus arrived at in discourse under                 ideal speech conditions. A requirement of genuine consensus is that discourse                 participants understand each other and have a shared understanding of normative                 terms. Three impediments to understanding threaten genuine consensus. We propose                 that encouraging participants to engage in life history dialogue prior to discourse                 will diminish these impediments. As a form of hermeneutic dialogue, life history                 dialogue serves as a model for how we come to understand ourselves, know each other,                 and may serve as a forum for cultivating understanding.},	keywords={discourse; life story; theory},	doi={10.1177/0959354305051366}}@article{RefWorks:724,	author={F.

As such, young readers of African American young adult literature are not necessarily prepared for the literary elements and style of canonical African American adult literature. Further, I note that editors, publishers, and literary critics may contribute to the construction of young adult literature, in that editors may discourage authors from experimenting with form and style.

Each chapter presents a survey of scholarly approaches to topics such as character, dialogue, genre or language, shows how those approaches can be brought to bear on a relatively well-known illustrative example, and indicates directions for further research.

In apparent contradiction with such a view, the present viewpoint proposes to conceive self and culture as a multiplicity of positions among which dialogical relationships can be established. Particular attention is paid to collective voices, domination and asymmetry of social relations, and embodied forms of dialogue. Cultures and selves are seen as moving and mixing and as increasingly sensitive to travel and translocality.

There is an increasing use of  narrative inquiry within the field of educational research. A  researcher's work with a Hmong refugee from Laos illustrates  representational and interpretive dilemmas in narrative research.  Narrative dialogues between the researcher and subject are presented as  juxtaposed stories and interpretations, transcribed conversations, and  reflections on the place of the poetic voice in narrative research. It  is emphasized that narrative research has the power to bring together  stories of informants and researchers, transforming the story and the  participants in the process. This process helps both the researcher and  the subject recover memories, renegotiate the present, and reconsider  the possibilities of change. At the same time, the researcher, as a  social scientist, must acknowledge that the ability to "know" through a  research process has its limitations, and that the reward of narrative  research is in its journey.

Current popular and scientific beliefs are contradictory, with the latter stipulating that personal memories do not begin until the late preschool years (age 4-5 years) and the former claiming that we not only remember being born, but can also remember in utero experiences. In this review, these beliefs are examined in a scientific context and evaluated in terms of empirical data about the development of early memory. The theory proposed here is that memories for personal experiences are not possible until the advent of the cognitive self, around the age of 18 to 24 months. This age is much earlier than that proposed as the age of the earliest memories in other scientific accounts and much later than that proposed in popular beliefs about early memory. New data from a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of early memory development and the emergence of the self clearly show the origins of personal memory coincide with the emergence of the early self.},	keywords={memory & reminiscence; children; theory},	isbn={0963-7214},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:581,	author={Michael F.

From a larger study of drinking careers among alcoholics  in Copenhagen, two interviews are singled out for a more detailed  analysis.

One thesis of the article is that the assignment of competence to interviewees reflects the degree of correspondence between the narrator’s interpretive framework and the theoretical preunderstanding of the researcher.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; emotion; practice},	doi={10.1177/107780040000600306}}@inbook{RefWorks:1211,	author={Karin Jasper},	editor={Brown,Catrina and Augusta-Scott,Tod},	year={2007},	title={The blinding power of genetics: Manufacturing and privatizing stories of eating disorders},	series={Narrative therapy: Making meaning, making lives},	publisher={Sage},	address={Thousand Oaks, CA},	chapter={3},	pages={39-58},	keywords={therapy; illness; mental health; life story}}@inbook{RefWorks:1929,	author={Alice Jedlicková},	editor={D'hoker,Elke and Martens,Gunther},	year={2008},	title={An unreliable narrator in an unreliable world: Negotiating between rhetorical narratology, cognitive studies and possible worlds theory},	series={Narrative unreliability in the twentieth-century first-person novel},	publisher={de Gruyter},	address={Berlin, Germany},	pages={281-302},	keywords={narratology; theory}}@article{RefWorks:2373,	author={D.

The analysis was a narrative inquiry, a qualitative approach based on the propensity of people to narrate or tell stories about the experiences in their daily lives. A purposeful sample of 35 youths ages 14-18 years with a variety of smoking histories (all had tried smoking) participated in in-depth interviews. A detailed analysis of the transcripts revealed the key identities communicated by the youths including the confident nonsmoker, the vulnerable nonsmoker, the ardent nonsmoker, the accepting nonsmoker, the in-control smoker, the confirmed smoker, and the contrite smoker. Tobacco control interventions for youth must be designed to respond to and incorporate multiple smoking identities. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Sufferers of bipolar disorder (manic depression) may  turn to the Internet for accessible information, to learn about others'  experiences and impart their own knowledge. Personal accounts posted in  the public domain become themselves part of those informational flows,  and thus acquire a dual life at a boundary between private and public  domains. This poses certain challenges for the investigation of  computer-mediated autobiographical telling, which are identified in  this paper and negotiated in an analysis of downloaded personal  accounts of bipolar disorder. Two of the stories are selected for a  close look. Story 1 tells about achieving long-term remission through  personal resolve and psychological alternatives to medication. Story 2  tells about becoming able to talk about the illness through the  achievement of a social identity as “manic depressive”. The stories'  similarities, differences, and comparability with the other texts are  discussed with a view to theorizing how such texts position their  implied author in the illness experience. Building upon Bakhtin's idea  of a text's plan and its realization, a concept of “identity  commitments” as textual properties is proposed.},	keywords={identity; digital storytelling; technology; philosophy; life story; mental health},	doi={10.1075/ni.15.2.06jon}}@book{RefWorks:2141,	author={V.

This is  particularly true for people trying to make sense of difficult or  traumatic experiences. Joint storytelling, or collaborative narration,  however, introduces elements not at work in individual tellings. In  this study, we looked for evidence of sense-making in joint stories  about difficult family experiences told by 12 families. Families' level  of engagement, perspective-taking, turn-taking, and expressed  interpretations all emerged as features relevant to the sense-making  process. During the storytelling episode, families engaged in three  forms of sense-making: (a) family-unit sense-making in which members  actively engaged in the process of telling the story together and  reached a shared conclusion concerning the meaning of the experience,  (b) individual family member sense-making in which family members  participated in the storytelling by sharing separate versions of the  story and reached individual conclusions about the meaning of the  story, and (c) incomplete sense-making in which one or more family  members were not engaged in the storytelling and no clear understanding  of the story's meaning emerged at either the family or the individual  level. This study offers an approach to aid in identifying  communication behaviors that accompany and help differentiate the  sense-making process in jointly told family stories about difficult  family experiences.},	keywords={family}}@article{RefWorks:1711,	author={Deborah Keller-Cohen and Cynthia Gordon},	year={2003},	title={"On trial": Metaphor in telling the life story},	journal={Narrative Inquiry},	volume={13},	number={1},	pages={1-40},	keywords={life story; autobiography & biography}}@article{RefWorks:2747,	author={J.

Second, the issues of autonomy and competence are considered from the point of view of identifying contexts where biography is a prerequisite for ethically responsive action. The third ethical issue concerns respecting the groundrules of various biographical approaches. Finally, the notions of authenticity and truth in lifestories are explored in an attempt to clarify the limitations and expectations of ageing and biography.

It constitutes a thorough critical evaluation of this approach for the feminist project of intellectual, social and political change. Original contributions by leading researchers explore the benefits and contradictions of discourse analysis and consider its value for feminist psychology. The first part of the book illustrates the application of discourse analysis to four key topics of feminist concern: adolescent knowledge about menstruation, sexual harassment, gendered representations of childhood, and anorexia nervosa. The second part contains five assessments of the usefulness of discourse analysis - both as theory and as method - for feminists. This book will be of great interest to critical theorists and discourse analysts across the social sciences, as well as to students and lecturers in social psychology, the psychology of women, psychology and language, women's studies, linguistics, sociology, anthropology and cultural studies.},	keywords={feminism; psychology; mental health; illness},	isbn={0803978014 9780803978010 0803978022 9780803978027},	language={English}}@misc{RefWorks:2698,	author={Daniéle Klapproth Muazzin},	title={Holding the world in place: Narrative as social practice in anglo-western and in a central Australian aboriginal culture},	journal={2001},	keywords={sociology; anthropology}}@inbook{RefWorks:2681,	author={K.

We focus on and analyse moments when the boys negotiate implicit challenges, make evaluations and offer assessments concerning their physical and sexual attraction to girls' looks. These moments are highly important for negotiating their peer status, for working toward a distinction between 'childhood' and 'adolescence', and for marking a normatively heterosexual self within a burgeoning institution of adolescence. We will specifically show how 'heterosexual desire' is carefully managed in group discussions where the boys participate in normative heterosexuality, but in ways that are nevertheless designed to appear mature and knowing, rather than shallow, naive or sexist. Three discursive methods of negotiation are identified and described in detail: (1) underscoring the non-literality of actions by appealing to motives, (2) denials with build-in concessions, and (3) differentiation through caricature. Couched within the proposed discursive framework, we are reversing the traditional logic of developmental approaches to 'maturation'. Rather than viewing maturation as the effect of resolving developmental tasks, we argue that 'maturity' comes to existence in the way talk is accomplished; that is, as highly flexible and fragile projections of identity that involve a continuous refinement of 'finely tuned positioning skills'.},	keywords={psychology; identity; gender; adolescence}}@book{RefWorks:1948,	author={J.

Narrative therapists take the view that 'unseen' aspects of power work to construct both how a person understands their situation, and how their relation to 'the situation' they find themselves in has been constructed through the discursive resources available to them. If the consequences of the operation of these discursive resources can be brought into view, then new resources may be mobilised to resist the problems that have been created by the 'power' of the discursive resources that are available in the status quo of people's cultural milieu. Narrative therapists work to disentangle the person from the problem, against the grain of the common constructions available in the resources of Occidental cultures that work to identify the person as 'the problem'. This is demonstrated in the assistance they offer to people in finding ways to resist anorexia, by identifying anorexia as the problem, and not the person as anorexic. In this perspective, other apparent tactics of resistance-such as the tactic termed 'pro-ana'-are revealed as counterfeit, and ultimately supportive of the problem situation.},	keywords={philosophy; therapy; theory; practice; mental health},	isbn={0306-9885},	language={EN}}@book{RefWorks:667,	author={David Lodge},	year={1992},	title={The Art of Fiction : illustrated from classic and modern texts},	publisher={Penguin},	address={Harmondsworth},	note={ID: 311337156},	keywords={literature},	isbn={0140174923 9780140174922},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:668,	author={David Lodge},	year={1988},	title={The Novel Now: Theories and Practices},	journal={Novel: A Forum on Fiction},	volume={21},	number={3},	pages={125-138},	note={ID: 481517076},	keywords={literature; theory; practice},	isbn={0029-5132},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:3090,	author={Buchanan M.

We have been working with a systematic analytic  approach which covers interactive and contextual aspects of the  interview situation as well as rhetoric and positioning strategies in  the act of telling.

Three successful cases of 8-session psychodynamic-interpersonal (PI)  therapy were selected on the basis of client Beck Depression Inventory  scores. One unsuccessful case was also selected against which  identified patterns could be tested. The successful clients were more  descriptive about their problems and demonstrated active  rapport-building, while the therapist used positionings expressed by  the client in order to explore the positionings developed between them  during therapy. The unsuccessful case was characterized by lack of  positive self-comment, minimization of agentic self-capacity, and  empathy-disrupting narrative confusions. We conclude that the theory of  interactional positioning has been useful in identifying patterns worth  exploring as early indicators of success in PI therapy.},	keywords={psychology; therapy; identity},	doi={10.1080/10503300500091249}}@book{RefWorks:2665,	author={Deborah L.

The goal of this study was to assess the impact of continuity editing on how people perceive the structure of events in a narrative film and to identify brain networks that are associated with the processing of different types of continuity editing boundaries. Participants viewed a commercially produced film and segmented it into meaningful events, while brain activity was recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We identified three degrees of continuity that can occur at editing locations: edits that are continuous in space, time, and action; edits that are discontinuous in space or time but continuous in action; and edits that are discontinuous in action as well as space or time. Discontinuities in action had the biggest impact on behavioral event segmentation, and discontinuities in space and time had minor effects. Edits were associated with large transient increases in early visual areas. Spatial-temporal changes and action changes produced strikingly different patterns of transient change, and they provided evidence that specialized mechanisms in higher order perceptual processing regions are engaged to maintain continuity of action in the face of spatiotemporal discontinuities. These results suggest that commercial film editing is shaped to support the comprehension of meaningful events that bridge breaks in low-level visual continuity, and even breaks in continuity of spatial and temporal location.},	isbn={0364-0213},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:2383,	author={M.

The study focuses on a series of encounters between  members of the Palestinian minority and members of the Jewish majority  in Israel. These encounters were designed to bring about better  understanding between the sides, and were led by two (one Jew and one  Palestinian) professional group facilitators. There is a significantly  unequal distribution of resources between Jews and Palestinians in  Israel, with the Jewish majority having more control over and more  access to social, political, and economic resources. Based on theories  of procedural justice and the role of process control, the present  study seeks to examine the extent to which this inequality in control  and dominance is also manifested in the features of discourse within  the encounter. Two indicators are used to identify manifestations of  dominance and control within the discourse. The first is based on the  gross amount of talk of group members and involves the distribution of  conversational turns among participants. The second indicator involves  controlling or challenging questions addressed by each group to members  of its own group and to members of the other group. Extracts from  transcripts of meetings are analyzed to compare frequencies of turn  taking and the distribution of controlling questions among Jewish and  Palestinian participants.},	keywords={sociology; discourse; subcultures; race & ethnicity},	doi={10.1023/A:1012893003614}}@article{RefWorks:658,	author={R.

This phenomenon, quotidian (re)framing, can function as a discourse strategy to decrease psychological intensity and to reground participants’ sense of self in the quotidian (quotidian self). The paper discusses uses and interactional functions of quotidian (re)framing based on examples in a range of linguistic and social contexts from older Japanese women's conversations to a talk show and to two American presidents’ interactions at public events. In contrast to many studies of discourse and in sociolinguistics that have focused on how participants of interactions appropriate or are given various identities, this study illustrates the importance of investigating how people agentively cast away the assumed identities to gain a better sense of self.},	isbn={0378-2166},	language={English}}@inproceedings{RefWorks:1480,	author={G.

I argue that both modes of discourse provide avenues for reasoning about clinical problems. However, these discourses construct very different clinical objects and different phenomena to reason about. Further, the clinical problems created through storytelling point toward a more radically distinct conception of rationality than the one underlying biomedicine as it is formally conceived. Clinical storytelling is more usefully understood as a mode of Aristotle's "practical rationality" than the technical rationality of modern (enlightenment) conceptions of reasoning.},	isbn={0745-5194},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:655,	author={C.

Therapists reason narratively when they are concerned with disability as an illness experience, that is, with how a physiological condition is affecting a person's life. In this paper, narrative reasoning is contrasted with propositional reasoning, and two kinds of narrative thinking are examined. The first is the use of narrative as a mode of speech that can be contrasted with biomedical discourse, in which disability is framed as physical pathology. The second involves the creation rather than the telling of stories. Therapists try to "emplot" therapeutic encounters with patients, that is, to help create a therapeutic story that becomes a meaningful short story in the larger life story of the patient.},	keywords={children; therapy; medicine; illness},	isbn={0272-9490},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:654,	author={Cheryl Mattingly and Linda C.

This chapter situates Cohler's original vision within the intellectual and scientific matrix of the late 1970s, wherein psychologists expressed grave doubts about the extent to which human lives may demonstrate consistency and coherence. By focusing attention on human beings as autobiographical authors rather than as mere social actors or motivated agents, Cohler moved the conversation away from dispositional personality traits and developmental stages and toward the emerging concept of narrative identity. Over the past 30 years, research on narrative identity has shown how people use stories to integrate the reconstructed past and imagined future, providing their lives with some semblance of unity, purpose, and meaning. At midlife, many adults struggle to solve the problem of generativity, aiming to leave a positive legacy for the next generation. Inspired by Cohler's original chapter, contemporary research reveals that the most generative adults in American society tend to construe their lives as narratives of personal redemption. As such, life stories may serve as valuable psychological resources for midlife adults, even as they reflect and refract prevailing cultural themes. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},	isbn={1520-3247},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:1959,	author={R.

Results showed an age-related increase in meaning-making but no gender differences in the degree of meaning-making.

At the New Kingdom village of Deir el Medina (c.1500-1100 BC) each of these data sets is available and can be used dialectically to gain a more intimate knowledge of lifecycles and individual life experience. Using excerpts from the documents and personal letters of the community I present the villagers' own narratives of life experience: pregnancy, birth, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, old age and death. These potent vignettes of life potentially have material correlates in the archaeology of the village - the individual houses and tombs which have remained in a remarkable state of preservation. For instance, the Eastern Necropolis at Deir el Medina is layered in terms of the lifecycle: neonates were buried at the base of the slope, followed by children and adolescents mid-slope and adults were buried at the high point of the hill. Using an explicitly narrative style, I aim to show the conjoinings and ruptures between various levels of evidence and, at the same time, allow for a more sensuous and embodied understanding of cycles of life in Egyptian culture.},	isbn={0043-8243},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1723,	author={Johann Baptist Metz},	editor={Hauerwas,Stanley and Jones,L.

Within each of these general categories, subclasses are distinguished in terms of the specific ways in which the central problem is addressed.

Morson asserts that the way we think about the world and narrate events is often in contradiction to the truly eventful and open nature of daily life. Literature, history, and the sciences frequently present experience as if contingency, chance, and the possibility of diverse futures were all illusory. As a result, people draw conclusions or accept ideologies without sufficiently examining their consequences or alternatives. However, says Morson, there is another way to read and construct texts. He explains that most narratives are developed through foreshadowing and "backshadowing" (foreshadowing ascribed after the fact), which tend to reduce the multiplicity of possibilities in each moment. But other literary works try to convey temporal openness through a device he calls "sideshadowing." Sideshadowing suggests that to understand an event is to grasp what else might have happened.},	keywords={literature; philosophy; ethics & morality},	isbn={0300058829 9780300058826},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:2798,	author={Gary Saul Morson},	year={1994},	title={Part I: The shape of narrative and the shape of experience},	series={Narrative and freedom: The shadows of time},	publisher={Yale University Press},	address={New Haven},	pages={15-116},	keywords={narratology}}@book{RefWorks:2924,	editor={P.

This paper examines a particularly intense phase of French cinema's quest for 'high culture' legitimacy, namely the period covering the Occupation and the rise of the New Wave - 1940 to 1958. It evaluates how the combination of historical circumstance and Vichy government policy enhanced the position of cinema relative to literature, and opened the way for subsequent deve/opments in literary and cinematographic expression, both as independent arts and in their interrelationship. Concentrating on works of fiction, it adopts the Ricoeurian view that such narratives afford crucial insight not only into artistic production, but also into the identity of the society that produced it.

It demonstrates how tellers and recipients of  stories orient to the upper boundary of tellability in various ways,  signalling discomfort as they approach the threshold of impropriety,  but also conspiring to breech and go beyond the boundary of impropriety  in the pursuit of greater intimacy and entertainment.

Shortly after completing their mandatory military service, young people set off on extensive backpacking trips to'exotic'and'authentic'destinations in so-called Third World regions in India, Nepal, and Thailand in Asia, and also Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina in Central and South America. Chaim Noy collects the words and stories of Israeli backpackers to explore the lively interplay of quotations, constructed dialogues, and social voices in the backpackers'stories and examine the crucial role they play in creating a vibrant, voiced community. A Narrative Community illustrates how, against the peaks of Mt. Everest, avalanches, and Incan cities, the travelers'storytelling becomes an inherently social drama of shared knowledge, values, hierarchy, and aesthetics. Based on forty-five in-depth narrative interviews, the research in this book examines how identities and a sense of belonging emerge on different social levels—the individual, the group, and the collective—through voices that evoke both the familiar and the Other. In addition, A Narrative Community makes a significant contribution to modern tourism literature by exploring the sociolinguistic dimension related to tourists'accounts and particularly the transformation of self that occurs with the experience of travel. In particular, it addresses the interpersonal persuasion that travelers use in their stories to convince others to join in the ritual of backpacking by stressing the personal development that they have gained through their journeys. This volume is groundbreaking in its dialogical conceptualization of the interview as a site of cultural manifestation, innovation, and power relations. The methods employed, which include qualitative sampling and interviewing, clearly demonstrate ways of negotiating, manifesting, and embodying speech performances. Because of its unique interdisciplinary nature, A Narrative Community will be of interest to sociolinguists, folklore scholars, performance studies scholars, tourism scholars, and those interested in social discourses in Israel.},	keywords={Youth; Israel; Social life & Customs; Backpacking & Social Aspects; Travel / Special Interest / Hikes & Walks; Sports & Recreation / Hiking; Sports & Recreation / Walking},	isbn={9780814331767; 9780814337585},	language={English},	url={https://login.proxy.hil.unb.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=e000xna&AN=454082&site=ehost-live&scope=site}}@inbook{RefWorks:2970,	author={A.

This paradox is brought into the open and clarified using as a starting point the ontological dualism of the Platonic-Christian tradition in which body and soul are seen as hierarchical opposites. The article shows how this dualism penetrates society and science and is carried on into the construction of gerontological concepts and theories, e.g. the 'ageless self' concept. The article also illustrates what consequences this dualism has for the everyday understanding of ageing based on biographical interviews with elderly Finnish people.},	keywords={identity; gerontology & aging; theory; autobiography & biography}}@article{RefWorks:1275,	author={M.

Stefinia was a participant in a classroom-based study that explored how developing students' knowledge of literary and illustrative elements affects their understanding, interpretation, and analysis of picturebooks and graphic novels, and the subsequent creation of their own print, multimodal texts. As well as being informed by narrative theory and metafiction, the research was framed by an ecological perspective on teaching and learning in classrooms. During a 10-week period, Stefinia participated in interdependent activities that offered her opportunities to learn about metafictive devices, some art elements, and a few compositional principles of graphic novels. Stefinia read and wrote responses to several picturebooks and four graphic novels; engaged in small group, peer-led discussions about the literature; and received explicit instruction about particular literary, illustrative, and compositional devices and techniques. She had the opportunity to apply and represent her learning by creating her own multimodal print text as the culminating activity of the study. The content analysis of Stefinia's written and illustrative text focuses on her use of various metafictive devices that disrupted narrative structures or ontological boundaries in her multimodal book. The findings reveal how Stefinia's participation and engagement in a particular classroom community of practice affected her learning of the content and concepts under study.},	isbn={1086-296X},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:2319,	author={I.

The findings suggest that late adolescents and early adults construct more meaning-laden, interpretive accounts of their everyday experiences when they converse with responsive friends.

In two  studies (n=100 dyads), speakers told attentive, distracted, or  disagreeable (Study 1 only) friends about a recent experience.  Distracted, but not disagreeable, friends tended to undermine  participants' attempts to verify their self-perception of being  interested in an activity (Study 1) or their self-perception that an  event was typical for them (Study 2). These results support the notion  that friends can be an important source of influence on  self-perceptions and, perhaps surprisingly, suggest that responsiveness  from friends, rather than agreement per se, may be crucial for  supporting self-verification processes.},	keywords={gender; identity; research}}@book{RefWorks:1989,	author={D.

As an alternative to the computer, such a metaphor, it is argued, comes closer to capturing the dynamics of memory across the lifespan and how it feels to us as we age, particularly memory's narrative dimensions. After citing concerns expressed by psychologists and others regarding computationalism, the paper considers four entailments of the compost heap analogy that may serve, very roughly, as counterparts to such concepts as encoding, storage, and retrieval. They are: laying it on, breaking it down, stirring it up, and mixing it in.

This article draws on recent thinking in narrative gerontology to look at three aspects of aging on which a narrative perspective can shed further light.

This work is grounded in Halbwachs' (1950/1980) theory of collective memory and in recent prospective studies of collective remembering within families from early childhood through adolescence. The claim is that the basic process of collective remembering is present from the earliest conversations about the past between parents and children, but it is not until adolescence that collective memory is informed by family stories and by history. There are both positive and negative consequences of collective remembering as a function of the nature of the collective. In conclusion, researchers are urged to broaden their view of the collective in their studies of autobiographical and collective memory.},	keywords={memory & reminiscence; autobiography & biography; theory; adolescence},	isbn={0965-8211},	language={EN}}@article{RefWorks:596,	author={Elaine Reese and Robyn Fivush},	year={1993},	title={Parental Styles of Talking about the Past.},	journal={Developmental psychology},	volume={29},	number={3},	pages={596-606},	note={ID: 425377776},	abstract={Examined discourse styles of mothers and fathers when talking separately with their three year olds about shared events.

The paper begins with a review of traditional attachment theory and concepts. The organizational perspective advanced by Sroufe and his colleagues is described in addition to other extensions of the study of attachment. The study of adolescent attachment is one extension of the attachment literature that has received increasing attention in recent years. A narrative review of studies of adolescent attachment is presented in which conceptualizations of adolescent attachment, methodologies, and results are described. The narrative review is followed by a metaanalytic review of this literature. The paper concludes by discussing the results of the reviews, the current state of adolescent attachment research, and some recommendations for further advancing the empirical and theoretical literature on adolescent attachment and adaptation.},	isbn={0047-2891},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:2762,	author={J.

It develops the premise that the reader evokes a literary work through selective attention to the details of the author's "paper and ink." Two types of reading are distinguished: "efferent" reading refers to what the reader "carries away" from the reading event (information, facts, solutions, required actions), while "aesthetic" reading refers to the feelings, attitudes, and ideas aroused in the reader during the actual reading. The degree to which readers use efferent or aesthetic reading activities affects their conception of the literary transaction. As examples from various types of literature show, these elements of transactional literary theory explain how readers evoke a poem, understand the openness or constraints inherent in particular texts, and interpret, appreciate, criticize, and most of all personalize the literary value of the text they read. The final result that transactional literary theory intends, then, is not so much to understand the completeness of a book as to understand the completeness of the reader.

Since then, work on autobiographical memory has matured, and the timing is right for a new overview of the topic in the form of Remembering Our Past, which brings together chapters by leading scientists in the field. The recent move of research in cognitive psychology out of the laboratory makes autobiographical memory appealing, because naturalistic studies can be done while maintaining empirical rigor. Many practical problems fall into the category of autobiographical memory, such as eyewitness testimony, survey research, and clinical syndromes in which there are losses or distortions of memory. Thus, the scope of this book extends beyond psychology into law, medicine, sociology, and literature. Remembering Our Past presents innovative research chapters and general reviews that will appeal to graduate students and researchers in cognitive science and psychology.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; memory & reminiscence},	isbn={0521461456 9780521461450},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:669,	author={David C.

The written texts were obtained from the archives of one of the authors who gathered autobiographies using a guided method of assigned topics of life. The main objective for this analysis was to find those central life goals and dominant activities around which the projects of life were formed. Sorting of life projects was done according to the constant comparison method described by Glaser and Strauss in their Grounded Theory model. Five types of life projects were identified in the narratives: living is achieving, living is being social, living is loving, living is family life, living is struggling. Considerable gender differences appeared in the findings with women showing a broader participation and interpretation of life where family life, community work and job careers were important. The men tended to be more monothematic focusing either on a personal achievement or a career development in a more social context. The rhetoric in the discourse of life themes was quite different between the sexes reflecting the sex role scripts of the cohort studied. Only in some of the types was the class dimension clearly visible where the type 'living is achieving' and to a certain extent even 'living is being social' reflected upper middle class and upper class occupations while 'living is loving' reflected middle class occupations. The positive narrative tone and the telling of well-managed life projects and success stories in most of the accounts were considered as American features in comparison to some Finnish life stories that contained more of the telling of hardships. The most gender bound accounts such as the masculine 'living is achieving' and the feminine 'living is loving' life projects shoed the greatest resemblances between these two wester cultures revealing comparable master scripts.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; gerontology & aging; theory; gender; culture}}@article{RefWorks:443,	author={J.

Through analysis of both clause-level expression of grammatical agency and discursive and cultural contextualization of agentive actions, it is shown that these young people, despite their apparent limited agency in the larger society, express moral agency through their active narration of the events of their lives. It is not only the content of these narratives, but also the way these stories are told that indicate the moral agency of the speakers. A conceptualization of moral agency is developed as it relates not to static universals, but to the shared particulars among this peer group and the common language they use to talk about their experiences.},	keywords={adolescence; subculture; ethics & morality}}@book{RefWorks:2131,	author={H.

If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. Sacks's splendid and sympathetic telling, deeply human. They are studies of life struggling against incredible adversity, and they enable us to enter the world of the neurologically impaired, to imagine with our hearts what it must be to live and feel as they do.

However, current visualization tools either lack support for storytelling or require significant technical expertise. Informed by interviews with journalists, we introduce a model of storytelling abstractions that includes state-based scene structure, dynamic annotations and decoupled coordination of multiple visualization components. We instantiate our model in Ellipsis: a system that combines a domain-specific language (DSL) for storytelling with a graphical interface for story authoring. User interactions are automatically translated into statements in the Ellipsis DSL. By enabling storytelling without programming, the Ellipsis interface lowers the threshold for authoring narrative visualizations. We evaluate Ellipsis through example applications and user studies with award-winning journalists. Study participants find Ellipsis to be a valuable prototyping tool that can empower journalists in the creation of interactive narratives.},	isbn={0167-7055},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:1276,	author={M.

Narrative construction of identity serves various purposes at different times. Both situational and trans-situational factors present a host of competing viable alternatives, attractive possibilities, and multiple constraints with regards to identity construction. The individual must navigate these and exercise choice in order to construct a particular manifestation of identity with narrative means. While Bamberg’s suggestion to focus research on identity performance in interaction with the help of micro-analytic study can contribute to identity research in valuable ways, I alternatively argue that research in this field would benefit more by focusing on uncovering narrators’ explicit and implicit intentions in constructing identities through stories, revealing the goals, constraints, and values guiding identity construction.},	keywords={psychology; research; identity}}@inbook{RefWorks:1175,	author={Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and Ronald S.

Schacter, chairman of Harvard University's Psychology Department and a leading expert on memory, has developed the first framework that describes the basic memory miscues we all encounter. Just like the seven deadly sins, the seven memory sins appear routinely in everyday life. Schacter explains how transience reflects a weakening of memory over time, how absent-mindedness occurs when failures of attention sabotage memory, and how blocking happens when we can't retrieve a name we know well. Three other sins involve distorted memories: misattribution (assigning a memory to the wrong source), suggestibility (implanting false memories), and bias (rewriting the past based on present beliefs). The seventh sin, persistence, concerns intrusive recollections that we cannot forget - even when we wish we could. Although these sins may cause difficulties, as Schacter notes, they're surprisingly vital to a keen mind."--BOOK JACKET.},	keywords={memory & reminiscence; theory},	isbn={0618040196 9780618040193},	language={English}}@book{RefWorks:571,	author={Daniel L.

Searching for Memory contains fascinating firsthand accounts of patients with striking - and sometimes bizarre - amnesias resulting from brain injury or psychological trauma. Schacter also takes us into the hidden world of implicit memories - unconscious influences of the past that, outside our awareness, affect our judgments, preferences, and actions.

Focusing on the consumer's experience of brands, the study interprets consumer narratives on how brand consumption contributes to the construction of the self. The findings demonstrate that consumers use brands in different ways: symbolic, iconic, and indexical. Apart from the symbolism of brands used to construct the self, consumers also use brands that resemble something in an iconic manner. Additionally, consumers use brands that have a factual connection to something in an indexical way to construct the self. Given these findings, this paper therefore contributes to both theory and practice. Theoretically, the findings support semiotic theory and the relationships between the object, the sign, and the interpretant. More practically, this work shows that recognition of the experiential meaning of brands informs marketers and brand managers on how to effectively market brands. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},	isbn={0742-6046},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:1236,	author={Neil Scheurich},	editor={Rudnytsky,Peter L. and Charon,Rita},	year={2008},	title={Reading, listening, and other beleaguered practices in general psychiatry},	series={Psychoanalysis and narrative medicine},	publisher={State University of New York Press},	address={Albany, NY},	chapter={14},	pages={247-260},	keywords={medicine; psychology; literature; therapy}}@article{RefWorks:2421,	author={A.

However, because my objective is to legitimatize narrative as an alternative vision of psychology, I frame these criticisms as challenges for narrative psychologists to overcome. I argue that narrative psychology has not clearly defined the meaning, scope and basic principles of a narrative approach. I ask: What does narrative mean? Is narrative ethnocentric? Is narrative a science? Can narrative reconcile with the mainstream without losing its critical spirit? can narrative survive in the academy? Although the challenges are significant, I argue that narrative psychology offers the promise of a systematic form of inquiry that explores meaning and intention in human lives. Narrative research promises to bring us closer to the real subject matter of psychological investigation, that of human intention and meaning, in its appropriate interpretive context.},	keywords={psychology},	isbn={1387-6740}}@inbook{RefWorks:1174,	author={B.

I read Goffman as  saying that the reality of selfhood is not an image, but a  psychobiological proces shaped by signs and symbols. Seen in this way,  the reality of the self is evident, as Goffman suggested, not in  conformity but in moments of feeling, resistance, and choice. Drawing  out what is implicit in Goffman, this article proposes that all forms  of signifying behavior, including self-presentations, are means to  sustain the coherence of the self. For this to work, however, people  must, as Goffman pointed out, trust each other to respect the rules  governing signifying behavior and must care about the feelings attached  to selves. The article argues that the inequalities of so-called  postmodern society are undermining the trust and care on which the  interaction order and coherent selfhood depend. Goffman's ideas about  the self are used to develop an optimistic critique of the conditions  that have produced these pernicious trends.},	keywords={emotion; identity; philosophy},	doi={10.1525/si.1993.16.4.333}}@inbook{RefWorks:995,	author={R.

Using Bruner's concept of the ‘narrative mode’, we argue for a revaluing of narrative and storytelling within higher education research. We ground our discussion in examples of research challenges where traditional quantitative methodologies leave certain things unsayable and look to our two disciplines - anthropology and philosophy - for solutions to these challenges. Anthropology's intimate and complex historical relationship with narrative offers us a range of narrative devices - unusual plots for research accounts, rich data, an ability to tell individual stories in micro-time and wider group narratives. Philosophy offers us a new view of imagination in epistemology and allows us to extend the boundaries of sight beyond individuals, considering the possibility of examining the university itself as a character, a reflexive subject. We argue that our disciplines’ capacities to tell these rare tales - oddly shaped personal narratives, group narratives, narratives with unusual characters, quests, reversals and tricksters, and stories that ultimately morph back into questions - allow us to find again some of the ‘forgotten things’ of higher education research.},	isbn={0729-4360},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:226,	author={C.

Although the use of  therapist-generated "therapeutic metaphors" has been widely advocated  and practiced for many years now, less attention has been paid to the  metaphors used by family members. We argue that the family's metaphors  are a neglected linguistic resource in family therapy. Highlighting and  validating these metaphors produces a therapeutic conversation in which  the voices of family members are heard more clearly by the therapist,  and the families' own imaginative energies are engaged in defining and  pursuing the goals of therapy. Several case examples illustrate the use  of this approach with children of various ages.},	keywords={family; therapy; practice}}@article{RefWorks:10,	author={W. Sims-Schouten and S. C. E.

However, these constructions are theorized as being shaped by the possibilities and constraints inherent in the material world. For critical realists, material practices are given an ontological status that is independent of, but in relation with, discursive practices. The advantage in taking a critical realist, rather than relativist, approach in that analysis can include relationships between people's material conditions and discursive practices. Despite calls to develop a critical realist discourse analysis there has been little empirical critical realist work, possibly because few have addressed the critique that critical realists have no systematic method of distinguishing between discursive and non-discursive. In this article we outline a three-stage procedure that enables a systematic critical realist discourse analysis using women's talk of motherhood, childcare and female employment as an example.},	keywords={children; discourse; women},	doi={10.1177/0959354307073153}}@inbook{RefWorks:1000,	author={J.

Insights into contrasts between them are also generated by exploring the emphasis given by each perspective to both the social and individual in creating selves and identities. These contrasts are organized along a continuum, with perspectives that adopt a `thick individual' and `thin social relational' view to the self and identity at one end, and those that adopt a `thin individual' and `thick social relational' view at the other.

His experiences post SCI illuminate the ways in which movement from one form of embodiment to another connects him to a dominant cultural narrative regarding recovery from SCI that is both tellable and acceptable in terms of plot and structure to those around him. Over time, the obdurate facts of his impaired and disabled body lead him to reject this dominant narrative and move into a story line that is located on Norrick's (2005) upper-bounding side of tellability. This makes it transgressive, frightening, difficult to hear, and invokes the twin processes of deprivation of opportunity and infiltrated consciousness as described by Nelson (2001). These, and the effects of impairment, are seen to have direct consequences for the tellability of embodied experiences along with identity construction and narrative repair over time. Finally, some reflections are offered on how the conditions that negate the telling of his story might be challenged.},	keywords={sport; disability; psychology; research},	isbn={0141-9889},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:555,	author={B.

From a perspective informed by autobiographical studies and the sociology of the body and illness, insights are provided into a variety of bodies, selves, and narratives that circulate within the text. The case is made that early in his sporting career, Armstrong develops a disciplined and dominating body that has an elective affinity for the cyborg narrative. On being diagnosed with cancer, these ideal body types lead him toward a restitution narrative. The illness experience, however, provides an opportunity for a communicative body to emerge that links him to a quest narrative. On returning to elite sport, former body-self relationships are restored and foregrounded. Issues are raised regarding the cultural shaping of Armstrong’s autobiography, and its form and content are problematized.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; illness; sport; identity},	doi={10.1177/0193723504269907}}@article{RefWorks:353,	author={A.

The model, referred to as developmental-constructivism (Kegan, 1994), suggests that, in addition to contextual factors, individual differences in the capacity for organizing experience will influence therapeutic efforts to generate new and more adaptive narratives. The model is also presented as a heuristic for comparing and integrating two influential approaches to narrative therapy: the externalizing approach of Michael White and the solution-focused approach of Steve de Shazer.},	isbn={0014-7370},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:3068,	author={ Streib H},	year={1999},	title={Off-road religion?

These indicate that obligation to a tradition is no longer the model for religious socialization. Its competitors are biographical trajectories which can have the following characteristics: heresy is taken for granted, religious search is like an open life-style preference (accumulative heretic); ritual coping with life themes is predominant; and religious search follows the motive of sensation-seeking. A typology of religious styles is applied as an interpretive framework for (a) explaining the formation of fundamentalist orientations and (b) understanding development and transformation in religious biographies.},	isbn={0140-1971},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:307,	author={L.

In Caseness a "mental health professional" negatively values those symptoms believed to be caused by a physical pathology. In the subsequent labeling of the "patient" a transfer of ownership of the person's body to the "medical system" occurs. Intervention ensues, by coercion and force if deemed necessary, to stop symptom expression. In contrast, the Narrative approach looks upon periods of distress as potentionally transformative experiences within the context of a life story. The complexity captured by a "narrative web," the emphasis on a dynamic self able to make choices, and a seose of closure are among the properties that Narrative highlights. This approach also helps redress the power disparity inherent in Caseness by letting the distressed person establish the discourse from which a dialogue can ensue. This article argues that the Narrative approach provides a more humane and healing context for people who are psychiatrically labelled.},	keywords={psychology; life story; identity; research; mental health}}@inbook{RefWorks:1105,	author={T.

"Swimme and Berry remind us of the importance of story - "story is the only way of providing, in our times, what the mythic stories of the universe provided for tribal peoples and for the earlier classical civilizations in their times." In a richly detailed narrative of epic sweep, they recount the unfolding of the universe, from the "primordial flaring forth" and the formation of galaxies and supernovas to the "human emergence," classical civilizations, and imminent Ecozoic era." "The Universe Story compellingly explores humanity's place in the evolving cosmos and our ecological imperative. Crippling the Earth's biodiversity, "we are deciding what species will live or perish, we are determining the chemical structure of the soil and the air and the water, we are mapping out the areas of wilderness that will be allowed to function in their own natural modalities." This, Swimme and Berry remind us, "is filled with risk and presumption," for "the story of the Earth is also the story of the human."" "Honoring "the special capacity of the human to enable the universe and the planet Earth to reflect on and to celebrate...in our music and our art, our dance and our poetry, and in our religious rituals," Swimme and Berry urge that we honor the knowledge gained by centuries of scientific inquiry with reverence, entrancement, and a commitment to renewal. Such joyous commitment is essential, for "there is eventually only one story, the story of the universe. Every form of being is integral with this comprehensive story.

Hasselbach, the founder (in 1991) of the National  Alternative neo-Nazi party in East Germany, writes about his childhood  and youth, how and why he embraced the neo-Nazi perspective, and how  and why he ultimately repudiated the movement that he had helped to  create. The analysis of Hasselbach’s story employs a “mediated action”  approach to identity formation (Penuel & Wertsch, 1995; Wertsch,  1998). Such an approach entails taking human action as the starting  point for the study of identity development, and understanding that  mediated action, rather than an inner sense of identity, continuity, or  sameness, provides the primary unit of analysis. In bringing a  sociocultural perspective to bear on Hasselbach’s autobiographical  narrative, this paper thus highlights the connections that emerge in  his autobiography between his changing/developing sense of moral  identity and his moral actions and interactions in the world. In so  doing, it explores and explicates the relationship between Hasselbach’s  moral identity and the sociocultural context in which it develops.},	keywords={identity; autobiography & biography; ethics & morality},	doi={10.1075/ni.10.1.05tap}}@article{RefWorks:367,	author={M.

Primary support for  this argument is taken from the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, who suggests  that the "authorship" of the narratives one tells about one's life is  always a function of both self and other. This dialogical perspective  is illustrated by an autobiographical account written by an emigre from  Nazi Germany in which the author tells the story of a series of  striking transformations in her moral self-moral identity, and in which  her moral authority-ethical responsibility gradually emerge from the  multitude of voices that she encounters in the social world. This  article concludes that autobiographies provide perhaps the clearest  evidence of the degree to which moral selfhood-identity is, at its  core, a function of the ongoing dialogical interchange between self and  others.},	keywords={ethics & morality; psychology; language & linguistics},	isbn={1072-0537/99}}@inbook{RefWorks:1735,	author={M.

In these terms, a narrative is generally understood in two ways. The first is as an established understanding of sequence or consequence, such as a potential life trajectory, which becomes a discursive resource for speakers to draw on. The second is of a narrative as a situated construction, such as the biography produced by a speaker within a particular interaction. In this article, I propose an expanded analytic focus which considers how the versions of a biographical narrative produced in previous tellings become resources for future talk, thus setting constraints on a reflexive speaker's work to construct a coherent identity across separate interactions and contexts.},	keywords={autobiography & biography; identity},	isbn={1387-6740}}@article{RefWorks:332,	author={S.

Two Russian students' texts, produced within the framework of an ongoing international research project, are used as examples, showing that literary competence cannot be reduced to internalized literary conventions, although they are recognized as a fundamental component of literary competence. In accordance with Mikhail Bakhtin, aesthetical reading is understood as a profoundly personal act, taking place beyond conventions. Therefore, if too much attention is paid to 'performance competence', two important components of literary competence can be overlooked: 'constitutional competence', the hallmark of the human species, according to Aristotle; 'literary transfer competence', more or less identical with the 'subtilitas applicandi' of the hermeneutic tradition. In the light of this broader understanding of literary competence, the article also tries to discern typical merits and weaknesses of literary school cultures in Sweden and Russia.},	keywords={subculture; identity; literature; philosophy; research; education; literacy},	isbn={0031-3831},	language={English}}@inproceedings{RefWorks:1099,	author={Alison Torn},	editor={David Robinson and Pamela Fisher and Tracey Yeadon-Lee and Sarah Jane Robinson and Pete Woodcock},	year={2009},	month={12 April 2008},	title={Madness, narrative loss and identity making},	booktitle={Narrative and Memory Research Group 8th Annual Conference},	publisher={The University of Huddersfield},	address={Huddersfield, UK},	location={Huddersfield, UK},	pages={137-144},	keywords={identity; mental health}}@article{RefWorks:2726,	author={T.

In simple and traditional English, he reveals how we use parable to understand space and time, to grasp what it means to be located in space and time, and to conceive of ourselves, other selves, other lives, and other viewpoints. He explains the role of parable in reasoning, in categorizing, and in solving problems. He develops a powerful model of conceptual construction and, in a far-reaching final chapter, extends it to a new conception of the origin of language that contradicts proposals by such thinkers as Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. Turner argues that story, projection, and parable precede grammar, that language follows from these mental capacities as a consequence. Language, he concludes, is the child of the literary mind.},	keywords={literature; theory; language & linguistics},	isbn={0195104110 9780195104110 019512667X 9780195126679},	language={English}}@misc{RefWorks:3156,	author={Underberg, Natalie M. and Zorn, Elayne},	year={2013},	title={Digital ethnography : anthropology, narrative, and new media},	note={ID: 830324097},	abstract={"Digital ethnography can be understood as a method for representing real-life cultures through storytelling in digital media.

Integrating insights from cultural anthropology, folklore, digital humanities, and digital heritage studies, this work brims with case studies that provide in-depth discussions of applied projects. Web links to multimedia examples are included as well, including projects, design documents, and other relevant materials related to the planning and execution of digital ethnography projects. In addition, new media tools such as database development and XML coding are explored and explained, bridging the literature on cyber-ethnography with inspiring examples such as blending cultural heritage with computer games. One of the few books in its field to address the digital divide among researchers, Digital Ethnography guides readers through the extraordinary potential for enrichment offered by technological resources, far from restricting research to quantitative methods usually associated with technology.

Against  the context of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission  that examined the crimes of apartheid, it discusses the narrative  implications of South African poet Antjie Krog's multi-layered text of  Truth Commission testimony, and autobiographical and philosophical  musings. The paper argues that narrative points to education in four  ways. The first involves research practices in which subjectivity and  experience are acknowledged, celebrated and recognised to be powerful  and compelling, allowing us to learn moral truths. Secondly, narrative  can be utilised as part of a pedagogy of care, compassion and concern  in which we ask questions regarding what it means to be taught by the  lives of others, and how stories that are not our own speak to those we  already have, enabling us to learn how to act morally through others'  experiences. The third aspect of narrative is then the identity work it  enables, offering the possibility for the reconstruction of the  learning “I”, inflecting away from past perspectives to new ways of  seeing. Through listening to others we might produce more accountable  and more responsible knowledge. Fourthly, we explore how narratives  might produce trustworthy accounts in which evidence is not endlessly  plastic, but where the narrative form enlarges the scope for  understanding. Throughout we show that individual and collective  narratives are played out on a structural field, embedded in the  political, social and historical conditions of a racial and gendered  power, with real material effects.},	keywords={discourse; race & ethnicity; history}}@article{RefWorks:2458,	author={J.

This film is a particularly telling example of obvious moralizing that also teaches other values, some positive and some that might be seen as negative. Its main message is that the hero, Simba, must accept the responsibility of being a future king. Another strong message is that the survival of the lion kingdom--and by implication, our society--depends on the relatedness of its members. By grounding the film's narrative in myth and infusing its story with moral purpose, Disney chooses the role of moral educator. In most instances, the film raises ethical sensitivity and suggests a positive direction, but if racism or sexism becomes the projected norm representing reality, Disney will lose its moral high ground.},	isbn={0195-6051},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:2677,	author={R.

In order to successfully create a coherent representation of the described situation, readers are required to monitor all these situational dimensions during reading. However, little is known about whether these dimensions differ in the ease with which they can be monitored. In the present study, we examined whether children in Grades 4 and 6 monitor four different dimensions (i.e., emotion, causation, time, and space) during reading, using a self-paced reading task containing inconsistencies. Furthermore, to explore what causes failure in inconsistency detection, we differentiated between monitoring processes related to availability and validation of information by manipulating the distance between two pieces of conflicting information. The results indicated that the monitoring processes varied as a function of dimension. Children were able to validate emotional and causal information when it was still active in working memory, but this was not the case for temporal and spatial information. When context and target information were more distant from each other, only emotionally charged information remained available for further monitoring processes. These findings show that the influence of different situational dimensions should be taken into account when studying children’s reading comprehension.},	isbn={0922-4777},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:103,	author={C.

Much of this research focuses on the  grander narratives we tell about ourselves, the big retrospectives  elicited from interviews. However, if identification is conceived as an  ongoing performance accomplished locally in and through everyday  interactions then it is the narratives that emerge in this context that  become the focus of interest. “Small stories” are the ephemeral  narratives emerging in such everyday, mundane contexts, which it is  argued constitute the performance of identities and the construction of  self. Drawing on Bamberg’s Positioning Analysis, this paper examines  the construction of identities in a “small story” told by two student  teachers, showing how this enables the participants to make claims  about their developing professional identities.

But his most famous hybrid creature manifests in La Belle et la bête: La Bête is alternatively human and animal. Animal ferocity masks la Bête's inner beauty, much as an elaborate mask conceals the physical beauty of actor Jean Marais. La Bête, perhaps Cocteau's best-known creation, exists in a liminal state that inspires first fear, but later affection and even love. As in the original narrative by Madame Leprince de Beaumont, when la Bête transforms into Prince Charming, Belle is confused and perhaps even deceived; she loves the animal, not the human who appears before her. After examining early depictions of human-animal figures in his theatrical works and films, this paper focused on Cocteau's imagining of la Bête as a profound depiction of hybridity. Ultimately, these hybrid creatures underscore a theme that pervades Cocteau's æuvre: a true love relationship is all but impossible in this life because of myriad obstacles; the hybrid condition serves as yet another barrier to be overcome.},	isbn={1740-9292},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:2327,	author={J.

Twenty subjects in each of five age groups (four, six, eight, ten years and adult) were asked to relate a narrative elicited from a picture book. All references to the animate characters in the book were coded for form (nominal/pronominal), and function (switch versus maintenance). Individual analyses of the narratives indicated that a variety of strategies were used across all age groups. Strategies identified included thematic subject, nominal and anaphoric. When the narrative was divided into segments based on the referential load of each segment, it was found that there was an interaction between the strategy adopted in the first segment, the age of the subject and the referential load of subsequent segments. A variety of strategies was adopted by all age groups although there were preferential trends observable within each group. The ability to maintain a strategy across the varying referential load of the narrative increased with age. Five developmental stages were identified from the analysis which enabled certain tentative predictions to be made about the way children approach a complex narrative task, suggesting that children pass through a number of stages which reflect their ability to organize the referential content of the narrative at differing speech levels.},	isbn={0305-0009},	language={English}}@article{RefWorks:1537,	author={L.

We begin by exploring general issues surrounding the ways in which content can be sub-divided into meaningful units for re-use and how criteria might then be applied to the selection and ordering of these units. We also identify and discuss the different means by which a user might interact with the content to create novel and engaging experiences. The Scene-Driver model has been instantiated using content from an animated children's television series called Tiny Planets, which is aimed at children of 5-7-year old. This type of material, being story-based itself, lends itself particularly well to the application of narrative constraints to scene reordering, to provide coherence to the experience of interacting with the content.We propose an interactive narrative-driven game architecture, in which a user generates novel narratives from existing content by placing “domino” like tiles. These tiles act as “glue” between scenes and each tile choice dictates certain properties of the next scene to be shown within a game. There are three different game-types, based on three different ways in which tiles can be matched to scenes. We introduce algorithms for generating legal tile-sets for each of these three game-types, which can be extended to include narrative constraints. This ensures that all novel orderings adhere to a minimum narrative plan, which has been identified based on analysis of the Tiny Planets series and on narrative theories. We also suggest ways in which basic narratives can be enhanced by the inclusion of directorial techniques and by the use of more complex plot structures. In our evaluation studies with children in the target age-range, our game compared favourably with other games that the children enjoyed playing.},	isbn={1071-5819},	language={English}}@inbook{RefWorks:232,	author={C.

Successful aging was operationally defined as higher than average ratings in mental and physical health and adjustment as determined by an interviewer and a panel of gerontological professionals. Reminiscence data were gathered from 88 men and women judged to be aging successfully and 83 men and women judged to be aging unsuccessfully. All subjects were between 65 and 95 years of age, with approximately half living in the community and half in institutions. As predicted, successful agers showed significantly more integrative and instrumental reminiscence but less obsessive reminiscence than their unsuccessful counterparts.

Most explanations rely on the  representational function of autobiographical discourse. These  representational accounts of narrative self-construction are  necessarily incomplete, because autobiographical narratives have  interactional as well as representational functions. While telling  their stories autobiographical narrators often enact a characteristic  type of self, and through such performances they can become that type  of self. A few others have proposed that interactional positioning is  central to narrative self-construction, but none has given an adequate,  systematic account of how narrative discourse functions to position  narrator and audience in the interactional event of storytelling.

The use of social aggression (e.g., concealed social attack) was associated with more individuals involved in the conflict. Social aggression was primarily reported as an initiating behavior for interpersonal conflicts, while direct relational aggression was a responding behavior. Medium to high levels of reciprocity were found for physical, verbal, and direct relational aggression, whereas a low level of reciprocity was reported for social aggression.
